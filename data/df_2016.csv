4.0,0002005263,"Hillerman has a poetic way of describing the setting for his stories.  The stories include
detailed information about the traditions of the Navajos...their beliefs and how they have

3.0,0001384198,"The reason that I gave this book three stars is that they have changed the engine to ""a girl"".  I recognize the value in that change for little girls and think it's perfect to teach girls that they can do what they want to do. However, I have a little boy. I have observed that we seemed to have moved from one extreme to another.  I want my little boy to know he too can reach for the stars.",2016-12-29,2016
5.0,0001384198,"I know this isn't the full version, which is part of the reason why I love it so much! It's a board book and the story is short enough (and fun enough) to keep a little ones attention all the way through.

4.0,0001384198,I enjoyed this book and my 18 month old does too.  My son LOVES books so this may be advanced for most 18 month olds.  I like that the book is full of vocabulary we tend to not use these days. The pictures are not my style but still good.,2016-12-05,2016
2.0,0001384198,It was ok. I had the original board book one and my son loved it. I had to replace it from all the wear of it being used. This one just seems like they cut out all the good stuff. Doesn't really feel like a story as much anymore. I hate saying that because I know there's always out there complaining when they revamp or edit a story. This time I think the editing cut down to much of the stories main theme.,2016-12-03,2016

However, the mini train was not included, which I'm pissed off about, since it's actually listed in the title of the item!! I don't want a refund, my husband just found a tiny miniature Thomas the Train that our grandson can drive along the tracks by hand instead. I'm just disappointed.",2016-10-25,2016

1.0,0001381733,"I have never been so insulted by a publisher's work (or lack thereof). What should be a lovely, classic book for children turned to be nothing but a cheap knock-off. Starting with the author's bio page, which was titled ""Jane Austen,"" followed by very grainy, low-quality pictures that had little to do with the subject, poem titles at the beginning and end of poems (the first poem ended with ""Bed Bed in in Summer Summer), oddly placed blank pages, and poem titles at the end of one page with the poem following on the next. I was so disgusted, I couldn't even show it to my child, lest he think that this was appropriate work. Robert Louis Stevenson is probably rolling over in his grave.

5.0,0001720392,"I purchased this book (as well as all of the other Dr. Seuss books) as soon as they became available for the Kindle.  It helped that there was a great promotional price at the time but the real motivator was to have them for my, at that time, infant grandson to read.

Fast forward a couple of years and I realized that while the Kindle version is great to have (especially when on-the-go), nothing really replaces having the actual book in hand for a toddler.  My grandson is now almost three years old and can handle the delicate process of turning thin, paper pages.  He loves to sit and read books to himself or to his baby sister.  Because of this new realization, I have decided to pick up the books in this series in hardback format.

Green Eggs and Ham is one of the wonderful books I remember from my own childhood and I love the book's rhymes and illustrations.  It was one of the Dr. Seuss books that I purchased and read to my children when they were young.  We still have those old books but I gave them to my daughters when they moved away from home so they could keep an important piece of their childhood with them.

We were celebrating  Dr. Seuss's birthday and we could not have a celebration without having Green Eggs and Ham.  The children absolutely loved the book.  They learned the phrases that were repeated and would start repeating them with me.  I loved watching them learn thru reading. It is amazing what 3 year olds can learn if you give them the opportunity.  The Cd was great as well.  I have it playing during play time and they will stop and listen and repeat the parts they know while playing.  You know you have a great book when they stop playing to interact with it.

1.0,0002051850,"I imagine that the reputation of this book as a classic has others afraid to admit that it is truly terrible.

The book has a few, fleeting moments of absolute genius (El Sordo's fight, Pablo's first uprising, etc.), but overall the book is horribly boring and completely unrealistic, at least to any American who has perhaps never experienced early 20th century Spanish culture.

This entire book is basically a love story between main character, Robert Jordan, and Maria, set against the Spanish Civil War. What makes this so unrealistic is that the book takes place entirely over only three days, and at the beginning of the book Jordan and Maria have not yet met. So, in the course of just THREE DAYS, we are expected to believe that they go from complete strangers to in love in a way that defies comprehension. Not only is this unrealistic, but it is also SO BORING. There are literally entire chapters of just Robert Jordan and Maria telling each other how much they love each other.

This book is described as a war novel, but its only a war novel in the sense that it takes place during the war. There is very little actual war that happens in this book.

Basically, the book is boring. It was a struggle to get through, and I only finished it because my OCD forces me to finish books I have started. But I hated it.",2016-06-10,2016

5.0,0002051850,"Its astonishing how many people, when one mentions For Whom the Bell Tolls, automatically say, Oh I read that. It is almost always a reading that happened many decades ago, perhaps in school, and many people recall only the love story, the earth moved interludes likely to impress a young person. This certainly describes me. It was on my familys bookshelf.

However, because I was reading Adam Hochschilds recent history of American participation in the Spanish Civil War (Spain in Their Hearts), I wanted to read the novel again. I am glad that I did, these many years later.

As a younger person, I am sure that I did not appreciate how the novel conveys the moral complexity of war. There is not only the Republican guerilla Anselmo, an old man who weeps when he must kill the enemy sentry, but the Nationalist lieutenant Berrendo, who must order the beheading of the dead El Sordo and his men, but cannot watch it. I am certain that I did not appreciate the character of Pilar, the powerful woman who dominates the band of men that Robert Jordan joins in order to carry out his assigned bridge detonation. Her description how her husband and his allies murder a towns Fascist officials is unforgettable. And Jordan himself is a far more complicated figure than I recalled. The life he lives in the few days he spends in the mountains is (perhaps) more full and more worthy than the life he might have had as a professor of Spanish back in Montana. He sees, hears, and feels everything in a state of intense hyper-alertness. However, there is nothing sentimental in this novel, no glorification of war or machismo, just a sense of lives lived for a just cause, teetering on the edge of eternity.

And then there are the planes, the mechanized and distant form of warfare feared and hated by the partisans. The impersonal bombs that rain down from on high are the future.

I thought this might be a good introduction to Hemingway - a good adventure story with lots of action and heroism - a story i could enjoy in case I did not like the prose.

Well, prepare to be delighted. The book contains all the things in the headline of this review and is absolutely not an action adventure story. It is a ""true"" story about the nature of war and how people affect it and are affected by it. What Mr Hemingway taught me is that he is a writer foremost and everything else after. He reminds us that he has been in actual war and that it affects very normal everyday people in generally awful ways. For them (us) there is no happy ending.

I found the book to be inspirational and engaging and written in a very simple style which makes the book more readable. Though the book raises really good points (there are few gems in the book that I haven't seen anywhere), I found it to be unoriginal. I must say that I was surprised by how freely the author takes other peoples ideas without giving credit to them (Victor Frankl, Stephen Covey, Napoleon Hill to name a few).

~ Robin Sharma from The Monk Who Sold His Ferrari

Robin Sharma is one of the worlds top leadership expertsright up there with Jack Welch and Tom Peters. In fact, he was recently recognized as the #2 leadership guru in the world. He also happens to be a great author and a super cool guy.

When I was running Zaadz, our companies did some work together and I got a copy of his book, The Greatness Guide. AMAZING. I loved it so much I had autographed copies sent to everyone on our team immediately. Several months later Robin and I connected in Los Angeles. Our breakfast turned into me driving him to the airport to continue our chat and, after 4 or 5 loops around LAX buying some time before his flight, I finally had to send him off with an OMG! I just met a soul-brother! hug. (Love it when that happens! :)

It's a fun, quick-reading fable that lives up to its subtitle of being about Fulfilling Your Dreams and Reaching Your Destiny. (Think: The Alchemist with yogi-attorneys rather than a shepherd. In fact, Paulo Coelho, another one of my absolute favorite authors, said this about the book: A captivating story that teaches as it delights.)

Here are some of the Big Ideas:

1. The 7 Timeless Virtues - of enlightened living.
2. Invest In Yourself - Its a good investment. :)
3. Blueprinting - It starts in your mind.
4. Secret of Happiness - Do what you love!
5. Rise with the Sun - Tomorrow AM good?

So, heres to creating a gorgeous little blip on the canvas of eternity glowing with the radiance of honoring our ultimate purpose in life.

5.0,0002163578,"Its easy to see why Cry of the Kalahari was a bestseller.  It reads like an old-fashioned melodrama from the 1930s - as if Mark and Delia Owens were channeling Edgar Rice Burroughs.  Delia is trapped in a flimsy little tent by two huge lions!  Jeepers!  Delia and Mark are deep in the Kalahari desert without any water!  Oh no!  A raging wildfire is headed straight for their research camp!  Good grief!

Will our intrepid duo survive these perils?  Not to mention black mambas, surly rebels, and a diet of mealie-meal?  Tune in next week, or in this case, keep turning the pages for another thrilling chapter!

Seriously though, as a retired scientist (who worked in a nice climate-controlled laboratory), I have tremendous admiration for what the Owens did in Botswana.  Their dedication, perseverance, and attention to detail epitomize what field work is about.  COTK is not an account of their research findings, but a personal account of what it was like out there.

There is good science here.  Their discovery that brown hyenas breed communally was a fascinating achievement.  As well, the Owens comparison of lion behavior in the Kalahari with that observed by Schaller in the Serengeti was very important.  To have a comprehensive picture of a keystone predator like lions, we must know how they adapt to very different environments.  Well done, Mark and Delia.",2016-04-25,2016

I will admit that reading the Broad Yorkshire accent as an American was hard at times since I couldn't always tell what things meant. Overall I liked the book and am happy to own it. It's truly a lovely story. I also really enjoyed towards the end where the author talks about how ruminating over negative things can cause the person to become negative and how helpful it is to just try to stay positive and think about pleasant things.

The edition I have is uncut and unabridged, so there are a few turns of phrase early in the book that stand out as racist, but since the character doing the talking in that moment was being described in really unflattering terms, and likely oblivious to the offensiveness of her word choices, I think leaving the scenes as-is lets them stand as moments of character revelation that might not be so effective if the language were watered down. She changes quite a lot across the book, so her sorry beginnings make the transformation somewhat poignant. Also, I'm not a fan of rewriting old books just to sanitize them. The author intended to create a certain effect with her word choices, so they should stand.

Most of the book is difficult because it's written in Yorkshire accent, so it's annoying.

5.0,0001945424,GOOD BOOK!!,2016-11-02,2016
5.0,0001945424,"Okay, I know that this story is completely unbelievable and cliche... Seriously, if a guy next door to a girls school started climbing into attics nowadays he'd be arrested. But the fact of the matter is, on a human, gut level, this will probably always be a classic of children's literature. Bennett's book is a simple morality tale that harkens back to the original Grimm Fairy Tales. Be good to people and karma will always pay off. Or conversely, if you are a horrible person, bad stuff is gonna happen to you.
Or more truthfully, if you are nice, good things well eventually happen for you, after you have suffered for a while to prove to the universe that you are worthy...even if you are a simple servant and not just a member of the privileged class.

I first read this on a rainy weekend in middle school, and I just re read it again today. I still love it, and it still made me cry, though unsurprisingly, not at the same parts I did as a child. As I child I cried at the injustice of what was happening to Sarah, as an adult I cried at the harshness of the world and the terrible beauty of small acts of kindness.

This is a book about never giving up hope. All in all, it was a good way to spend the day.",2016-10-30,2016
5.0,0001945424,"It is a wonderful story and, though the writer certainly did not know it at the time, it is a book about neuroplasticity (changes in the brain made by life's course and behavior changes). I'd recommend this book to anyone of any age who needs to know they are able to change their way of thinking. Each time I read it I see new ideas and inspiration. I am trying to find something I didn't like, maybe to see the children as adults and see what they did with their lives.

This story of the transformation of a whiny orphan and of a whiny motherless child into happy healthy active children is charming, exciting, mysterious and thoroughly wonderful.

5.0,0001945424,"The book has nothing to do with the movie, here the lives of the three children are secret, more realistic, no Hollywood glamour leading us to wrong assumptions.
The Secret Garden is basically the story of two orphan preteens, obnoxious, feeling entitled, who meet and become friends.
Once they meet a boy their age, belonging to the lower class family of 14 siblings, their view of the outside world and their place in it is changed forever. They transform into very like able characters.
There is much more, there is the garden and the healing it brings, the animals met in the secret garden, nature in all her glory, playing alchemy in the lives of these three children.
The concept of a mother's love, faith in God, trust in someone, all these discoveries are so important in the lives of the children...
Boys and girls will like the story equally.
Enter the world of imagination of children. Lose yourself in the story. Those moral concepts are not portrayed anymore in our century. This book is a real gem for serious readers...",2016-07-23,2016

The books are technically children's books, but I enjoyed them as a child and an adult.  There's definitely a Christian message behind the books, but it's balanced at a point where Christian readers can enjoy and learn from the themes, but it's not so overpowering that a non-Christian reader couldn't also enjoy the books.",2016-11-15,2016

5.0,0001844423,"No review is necessary for the Chronicles of Narnia series. It has withstood the test of time and proven itself a classic. I enjoyed them as a child, reading and rereading them all. Now as a father, I get the joy of reading them with my daughter, and once again I find myself drawn back into Aslan's world and enjoying ever second of it.

The boxed set was an incredible value. The books are about the quality of mass market paperbacks, in other words, not high quality. But they are good enough quality and I was able to get the whole set for under $20. So I am quite happy with the purchase.",2016-08-17,2016
5.0,0001844423,"Reader thoughts: An escape in the night, an abandoned castle, ancient ruins, a thwarted murder, a near-drowning, a werewolf, and a final duel. This book sounds like horror, but it's not. Part of that is probably because most of it is told through the story of a dwarf.

I love the bear sucking his paw. I love Reepicheep and his tail. I love the teacher drawn into the dancing and singing parade. I love that Edmund forgets his flashlight. I love that the dwarf has to run to Aslan. I love that the Telmarines were descendants of pirates.

Caspian says, ""I was wishing that I came of a more honourable lineage.""
Aslan replies, ""You come of the Lord Adam and the Lady Eve. And that is both honour enough to erect the head of the poorest beggar, and shame enough to bow the shoulders of the greatest emperor on earth. Be content.""

Writer thoughts: Why is it that some books can be read over and over without exhaustion, and some books need only be read once? Is it the reader's preference, or is it something the writer has done to the writing or story?

I suspect it is both. In the case of the Narnia books, I daresay the credit belongs to Lewis. His characters are real and complex, and his writing style is simple. I mean that it doesn't try to make the reader guess what's happening or why. It doesn't try to use fancy wording or strange metaphors with lots of purple prose.

What are some other things Lewis does that make his books timeless?

Happy endings. Clear good and evil. Problems relatable to our world. The frankness of the dialogue (on-the-nose dialogue is usually a bad idea, but his works well).

The number one factor, though, is probably nostalgia. So many people have read these as young kids and remember them from that. (This can't be the only aspect because there are plenty of children's books that aren't worth reading over and over and over.)

Without Lewis's books, I would argue that a book needs subtlety and layers in order to be enjoyed again. I would have said a book needs to hide a few discoveries in its folds so that readers can find them the second time through (like foreshadowings). However, Lewis shows that's not strictly necessary.",2016-08-16,2016
5.0,0001844423,"Reader thoughts: I love that Aslan is singing to make the world! I love that Digory admits he was wrong to ring the bell and that he wasn't really enchanted. I love when he comes out of the pool and tells Polly he's been there forever. I love that Uncle Andrew is planted. I love that the witch can't do magic in London. I love how Polly and Digory meet. I love that the Jackdaw was the first joke. I love that they planted the toffee tree.

I love that Digory wants so badly to use the apples for his mother and that the witch says the excuses we think ourselves. Here's a paraphrased conversation between him and the witch.
Witch: ""Use the apple to make your mother well.""
""Oh!"" Digory put his hand to his head. For he now knew that the most terrible choice lay before him.
""Cruel, pitiless boy! You would let your own Mother die!""
""But I promised!""
""But you didn't know what you were promising.""
""Mother would tell me not to, if she were here.""
""She need never know.""

Writer thoughts: CS Lewis knows how to write about the hearts of people. I haven't found another author better at writing about what really goes on inside the depths of humans' souls. Orson Scott Card reveals candid glimpses, but it's nothing as consistent as Lewis. What makes me say Lewis does this so well?

Think about Terry Pratchett's explanation of second thoughts (and third thoughts and fourth thoughts). He shows a little of what humans are thinking behind the first layer of thinking. CS Lewis discusses these innermost thoughts quite casually, throwing them in his prose for all readers to consider.

If you saw your enemy drowning, your first layer of thoughts might be, ""Somebody help him!"" Everyone really is a decent human being on the surface. The next layer might be, ""I should help him,"" but is your compunction here strong enough to overcome the third thoughts (""He deserves to drown"") and your fourth thoughts (""I'd probably drown and cause more harm than good"") or does your enemy drown? Perhaps there are fifth and sixth thoughts helping you decide what to do in that moment, too.

The thing is, many authors focus on the first layer of thoughts (if they breach inner dialogue at all). Other authors let readers glimpse second and third thoughts. Very good authors make the readers aware of fourth thoughts, even if they don't always state them. CS Lewis consistently lays bare all layers of thoughts/motivations/feelings/impulses/instincts that his characters have at complicated moments.

That's the key, though. He picks just the right moments, when his characters are in full moral dilemma, to show readers how conflicted the characters are.",2016-08-16,2016

5.0,0001844423,"The person who's been reading through The Narnian Chronicles will find in this final book of the 7 a difference in tone - a foreboding - right from the start. I'll try not to spoil anything with details; the story is good, but quite different than the others. Like the others, there are many quotable lines that show wisdom and spiritual maturity, and deserve to be pondered and shared. For example, one enticing line (paraphrased from memory) is: ""Everyone receives what they truly seek.""

The Last Battle contains much of Lewis's theology of heaven (which he more fully explored in his novel ""The Great Divorce"" (the ""divorce"" is the separation between Heaven and Hell)), as well as in some of his stand-alone essays on the subject. We see who (Lewis believed) arrives in heaven and who does not, and why. We see a kind of purgatory, and his view of ""the new heaven and new earth"" of Scripture. We see what is allowed and not allowed in each (though it is not always explained just why some of the allowances and restrictions exist). He provides some great metaphors for the afterlife (Good and Evil) which are worth meditating on and appreciating.

Many who agree with the rest of Lewis's theology will disagree with some of his theology about heaven. But, as he says in one of his essays about belief in the Satan and demons, these are not crucial to the faith, they are opinions which he believes are the best answers we have at this point, and his faith (and ours) will not be thrown on the rocks if we discover the details to be otherwise.",2016-06-13,2016

The movies were absolutely terrible compared to this in my opinion, possibly in general - major let down. But radio drama, and these stories in particular, were awesome!!!! My wife and I had such a blast listening to these.

This is a side note, but the actor for Aslan is WAY better than Liam Neeson (played Aslan in the movies). I found this stunning because Neeson has such a great voice, and generally I really like Neeson, so I thought he was going to do great in the movies, but he was just a flop. I'm telling you that the actor for Aslan in these radio dramas was FANTASTIC! You really get a sense for the depth and character or Aslan, so that you perceived multiple aspects of his personality, the way that C.S Lewis wanted. C.S. Lewis was a Christian, writing a Christian related series of books after all. I found Neeson to be very one dimensional in the movies, just monotone, and boring. I partially think this had to do with the directors of the movies having no interest in portraying Aslan as his true representation of God, in all His glory, majestic, and depth of character, but this is pure speculation on my end.

5.0,0001844423,"This is a prized possession of mine.  I love anything to do with C S Lewis and the Chronicles of Narnia, and since I have many hobbies that take my visual concentration, yet leave me wishing for some audio interest, I find myself returning to these stories and this series time and time again.  I have several different versions of the audio books, and each are individual and unique... The Focus on the family series paints such a lively picture in your mind with exceptional quality and audio clarity.  The BBC collection is also excellently performed, complete with music and sound effects, and it was such a pleasant surprise when I stumbled upon that production....I had no idea it was ever made until about a year ago.

This, however, is the quintessential Narnia audio collection, direct from the pages of C.S. Lewis, word for word, unabridged, and so respectfully compiled.  I love the actors' renditions of the stories, each beautifully read, and the English accents add such an authentic flare.  My 2 favorite stories...(though I love them all!)...are ""The Lion, The Witch & The Wardrobe"" (narrated by Michael York), and ""The Last Battle"" (narrated by Patrick Stewart).  These actors truly show off the full range of vocal talents. It is such a joy to live in a day and time where so many versions of these beloved stories are available to us to relive, enjoy, and share with the next generations.  My children will be introduced to the stories at a young age and will cherish them as much as I do, I have no doubt.  It is a classic series, and the stories will live on forever  in literature.  I only wish I had been alive and able to meet CS Lewis.

On a side note:  Coloring in adult coloring books is one of my newest craft hobbies, and these stories are still in my list of favorites to listen to while relaxing with my artwork.

5.0,0001844423,Classic C S Lewis.,2016-04-22,2016
5.0,0001844423,"I first became aware of The Chronicles of Narnia from the 3 movies (The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe, Prince Caspian, The Voyage of the Dawn Treader) that have been released. Then I came to know their well-known author CS Lewis and that the movies are based on his novels. And reading the original novels has then always been on my mind.

In reality, The Chronicles of Narnia comprises of 7 books, of which only 3 have been released as movies. I read these in the chronological order that CS Lewis would have recommended his readers; The Magicians Nephew, The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe, The Horse and His Boy, Prince Caspian, The Voyage of the Dawn Treader, The Silver Chair and The Last Battle. Throughout the books, there are biblical instances that I could identify such as the death and resurrection of Aslan, the Ape Shift as the false prophet, etc.

I am glad that I follow this order as this evolves right from the first generation; Digory  the Pevensies uncle  and Polly in the first book The Magicians Nephew. As one can only enter Narnia as a child, after Digory and Polly had put on in years which made them no longer able to re-enter Narnia, then came along the second generation; Peter, Susan, Edmund and Lucy Pevensie.  In the book Prince of Caspian, this is where Peter and Susan were able to last visit Narnia as they were growing up as young adults.  The Pevensies cousin Eustace Scrubb made his first foray into Narnia in the book  The Voyage of the Dawn Treader, accompanied by Edmund and Lucy. This book marks Edmunds and Lucys last visit to Narnia as like Peter and Susan, they were growing up. The rest of the books describe the third generation; Eustace Scrubb and his school-mate Jill Pole.  Reading the final book The Last Battle, the biblical book of Revelations come to my mind, the passing of Old Narnia and entering to new Narnia. And in this book, all the characters starting from Digory, Polly, Peter, Edmund, Lucy, Eustace, Jill and the Narnia characters Caspian, Lord Drinian, etc came alive in the new Narnia.  Susan was not among them as she had chosen to forsake and renounce her belief in Narnia. There was an unexpected twist in that Aslan had told Digory, Polly, Peter, Edmund and Lucy before that they were no longer able to re-enter Narnia, but yet they did manage to re-enter Narnia. I will leave you to read to find out this twist that I am referring to.

Reading these books make me feel like CS Lewis was narrating his novels to me, as often he would use a first persons narrative. Eg phrases such as (at least, Im sure Im not), (By the way, I have never yet heard how these remote islands became attached to the crown of Narnia, if I ever do, and if the story is at all interesting, I may put it in some other book).

Overall, I enjoyed reading this book and I highly recommend everyone to read the actual novels.",2016-04-21,2016

5.0,0001844423,"Well, what can I say that has not been said about this excellent series. This is the original numbered reading order of The Chronicles of Narnia and the way they should be read, as written. I won't get in to the whole argument about Mr. Lewis trying to be nice to a little boy, and just to appease the child, agreeing with him that he might be right. Us true Narnia lovers know that if he intended to change the order he had plenty of time when he was alive after answering the letter. Reading the books in any order but this for the first time would simply ruin the whole story. After its read, jump around and reread it in any order. The surprise ending isn't a surprise if you read it first.

It doesn't seem to have all the art work (I've compared to a couple different library versions), but the stories are there and there are enough pictures to keep the kids interested. I would say that my 10 year old son is more interested than my 7 year old daughter.

Absolutely magical reading of the unabridged texts!  Our daughter delighted in these readings on long car-trips during summer/ school vacations from the age 8-10.  She was totally rapt in attention (which, by the way, is a way to hone reading skills through an auditory process). We re-listened to all of them at least once.  I enjoyed the different readers:  These actors are so well known to me, it was an absolute delight to hear them.  I must point out that Kenneth Branagh was absolutely hysterical.  He does comedy extremely well and had me guffawing out loud. Regarding the very contentious issue of the ORDER in which to proceed:  We ended up listening in the order of publication, starting with ""The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe""  -- but that was only because that was the order in which my husband and I had both read the novels when we were kids.  He had read the entire series; I had the joy of discovering the rest of the series with our daughter with this set.  I don't think there's any wrong or right way to go about listening/ reading these -- ie starting with either chronological with ""The Magician's Nephew"" or in order of publication with ""LWW"" as we did.  Our daughter proceeded to read the novels after listening to these marvelous readings.  What a really splendid joy!",2016-02-01,2016

If ever there were a book that i could describe as life-changing...it would be this one.

Is it for everyone? Absolutely not.
There are sections of this book that are brutal. That are intensely hard to read. And there are themes throughout the book that might be triggers for some people.

But, for me this was easily one of the most beautifully written books i have ever come across in my life. I literally ran out of my trusty small post its due to all the sections I marked.

I am still trying to process my thoughts after finishing this several hours ago, but i do hope at some point to be able to come back and write a proper review to try and express just how much this book effected me.

4.0,0002117908,"The introduction was very descriptive and by itself worth the read.  Rousseau's famous writing is a somewhat odd work which leaves many questions.  The author's primary focus is submission to a ""social contract"" to legitimize political rule...if everyone gives up the same rights, everyone will feel free.  He denounces luxury and property as immoral and states that subsistence living is the most moral life to lead.  He describes the ideal society as being lead by a ""sovereign"" (seemed to imply a democratic sovereign, as in different varieties of majority rule) and a ""government"" (executive branch to enforce laws set by the sovereign).  He details how this system can go wrong if branch powers are not proportioned (can't enhance sovereign legislation if executive branch lacks power to enforce...etc.).  He also describes how the size and characteristics of a kingdom are likely to produce a unique style of government.  He talks much about the dangers of larger states, and thus may support smaller states, but it wasn't entirely clear to me.

Perhaps it was my comprehension, but the author made remarks throughout the book which seem to offer some refutation of his own claims.  He talks about how inhumanly moral a government leader should be, but then still accepts human leadership.  He speaks of the best ways to elect reps, but also speaks poorly of representative sovereign agents in general.  At one point he appears very against force, and at another he feels it is ok.  He seems to accept that individuals will always seek their own interest, and that this should be allowed, but then suggests that all need to forgo this reality in favor of the ""general will.""  In other words he appeared to support secession if individuals did not agree with the general will.  His definition of liberty was also difficult to understand, though this was an expectation set in the intro.

There is much discussion of democracy vs aristocracy vs monarchy, basically an extension of Aristotle's Politics.  Upon reflection, this work was likely influenced by events around him (pre-French Revolution)...possibly feeling more radical now than it would have then. After all, in Rousseau's own world he'd hardly have time to write his books!",2016-04-22,2016

4.0,0002117908,"This book is a well-done standard edition of the most important of Jean-Jacques Rousseau's political writings, using the classic Cole introduction and translation.  It is nicely bound, in the manner of quality books before cheap paperbacks took over the industry. The size, 4.5"" x 7.25"" 325 pages,  makes it a convenient carry-along for reading, as usual in the Everyman's Library.  Good quality printing and binding in every respect.

There are other more current editions of Rousseau's writings available, but this one has stood the test of time.

With that, Cole was sympathetic toward Rousseau's political theories, which makes for good translation, but not a very objective analysis. In my opinion, Cole completely misunderstands the implications of Rousseau's invocation of the General Will, which perhaps with some distortion by later readers, has been responsible for many of the social-political disasters of the past two hundred years, including the Reign of Terror and guillotine excess of the French revolution under Robespierre.",2016-01-21,2016
5.0,0002117908,"The Social Contract, published 1762, is a very elegant piece of writing. Rousseau's knowledge of history, human nature, and his use of logic create a cogent argument. He illustrates through example how men can live together with equality and equity if allowed to. The modern reader might think the ideas of the French Enlightenment obviouseven quaint.

The oppression, torture, and death inflicted upon the common man by the early and middle years of Christianity have since disappeared, but human nature has remained constant. For recent generations the reign of Stalin, Hitler, and Mao Zedong are living memories; and now, with the fiefdoms of Islam, it is happening again.

How quaint is the advice given to us centuries earlierhow deaf have we become?

Both of my kids were born in the US and I read for them every single day. They are growing up hearing different stories then I did, and I am very much enjoying the ride with them.

When I first read them a Dr. Seuss book I had mixed feelings. I honestly wasn't very sure if I had liked it or not. But after reading a few books, it just grew in me. Dr. Seuss' books are magical. There is something about them (their oddness, I presume?) that simply sticks to your mind. And most of them have a very nice hidden message among all the chaotic scenarios and crazy characters.
Now Dr. Seuss is one of my favorite authors, and The Cat in The Hat my favorite character.

This book is simply great for preschoolers and kindergartners (older kids too!). The rhymes and the humor are spot on.
