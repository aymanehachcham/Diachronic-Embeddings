5.0,0001381733,"There are many editions of Robert Louis Stevenson's A Child's Garden of Verses.  This one is notable because  it is illustrated by Eve Garnett, who has filled this edition with most delightful pencil sketches and drawings.  Next to Tasha Tudor's illustrations for the poems she selected for her collection, Wings From The Wind, I like these lovely (on a smaller scale) drawings by Eve Garnett.  Garnett was the first British writer of children's stories to write wonderful stories of working class families (in London) (The Family from One End Street, etc.), and she illustrated her own books.  A small gem of a story of hers (""The Kind Visitor"") can be found in a collection of stories titled: A Golden Land, edited by James Reeves.  The story originally appeared in Eve Garnett's collection of four of her stories, called:  Lost And Found.  Sadly consider how many excellent books and stories are ""lost"" to today's children because they are out of print!  This edition of RLS's poems is also out of print.",2017-04-20,2017

5.0,0002051850,"THE OPERATOR

What makes a good book?  A good story, a good writer!  What makes a good reader?  There must be, for me, some connection with the subject matter, and there must a real interest in understanding what the author is trying to say.  Of course, that begs the problem of each (writer and reader) being able to discuss the book either with the author or another reader.

I liked the book because of the honesty of O'Neill, and I have several qualifications.

First, it was interesting because it explains, in detail, what was/is involved in becoming a Navy Seal; second, the story was told (1st Person) through the eyes (memories and judgment) of one individual (a personal narrative).

Qualifications: Robert O'Neill went through several real and important transitions that I related to.  One was his relationships with his fellow Seals and, especially, those who were on his various teams.  These relationships were very strong; they were a transition from a  narrow, personal concern for becoming a Seal to creating a family unit on which military combat relies.  When O'Neill began to change, mature past his Seal experiences, he was finding that many of his Seal brothers were becoming envious of his notoriety  and, therefore, a lack of connection which had been some vital was experienced.

Another important relationship was with his wife and children.  This was mentioned in very minimal terms which is somewhat understandable because of the lack of time spent with them.  As his story developed, they became more significant, but it left me wondering about his wife's perception and feelings.  I thought that this deserved more attention because of its importance.

The last chapter (23) is quite an ending, and yet it is a beginning for O'Neill.  His view of his life and that The Seal Bubble as over is important.  That statement explains his view of the changes he experienced, of transition from one life-stage to another.  Life-stages are often age/maturity related in combination with changes in activity.  It is a growth and adaptive process which can be difficult.  He recognizes that he is in transition and that he believes his Seal experiences and his processing of those experiences has prepared him for a new stage.  This chapter should be a new book.

I recommend this book!",2017-09-04,2017

4.0,0002051850,"Hemingway set this in the Spanish Civil War (1936-39). Robert Jordan is an American professor of Spanish from Montana who has journeyed to Spain to fight against the Fascists/Nationalists on behalf of the Communists/Leftists. He is a dynamiter who has been tasked with blowing up a bridge. He spends a few days with Pablo's band of guerrilla fighters. He falls in love with a young woman named Maria who has experienced a number of atrocities.

In one long chapter, Hemingway describes the horror in which the Communists slaughtered Nationalists and their sympathizers in small towns at the outbreak of the war. He also has a somber tale of the last stand of another guerrilla party. There is love, loss, suspicion, betrayal, hope and regret that run throughout this. At times, Hemingway goes on longer than one may like. The payoff is in the end though. It ends brilliantly.

This is not Hemingway's best book on war - that would be ""A Farewell to Arms.""",2017-03-14,2017

Hemingway's ability to create emotion and atmosphere that ""takes you there"", where the action is, is surprising, to say the least. Another: ""can't put it down"".book.

3.0,0001945424,"Impossibly perfect young Sara Crewe remains kind, generous, studious, loyal, brave, and considerate through thick and thin - - being treated as a princess in her boarding school because of her wealth, then losing everything and nearly starving in a garret and suffering abuse from those who had sucked up to her when she was rich, but ending up even richer in the end.  The comeuppance for the greedy people who abused this paragon is so satisfying that it obscures the great holes in the plot. A key character is introduced as an Indian servant who speaks no English, but somehow he manages to communicate quite nicely with his Eton-educated English employer and a young English secretary about a complicated scheme to help the distressed child, only to revert to very simple English later.  The diamond mine that catapults Sara from poverty to riches is, in her imagination, worked by dark men with heavy picks, but somehow her compassion and generosity doesn't extend to them, and her imagination doesn't raise the question why an English child should prosper from their back-breaking labor in a far-off country. She recognizes and rejects false friendship from English people, but when dark-skinned adults bow to her she is pleased and untroubled. Obviously, this book is a product of the Colonial Era and can't be expected to present an enlightened picture of the rights of the people of India, but it presents such a sunny view of the dark-skinned servants and laborers happily making young Sara wealthy and pampered that it would be nice to see her showing a little bit of empathy for them, rather than spending it all on the poor in London.",2017-10-22,2017
5.0,0001945424,"This is a classic story that we loved as children. I was drawn to reread it after seeing the musical Secret Garden on stage. The stage show is very different from the story, but both have their strengths. Mary Lennox is an unpleasant, sallow little girl who is orphaned in India when a cholera plague swept through their area. Her life in India had not been idyllic as she had been ignored by her parents and virtually friendless. She is sent to live with an uncle in Yorkshire England. She has never been to India and never met the uncle. Her uncle, Archibald Craven has not been coping since the death of his young wife 10 years before. Fortunately, Martha is there with her good nature and good sense. Martha and her brother Dickon work their magic. The first part of the book remains charming as the orphan Mary arrives in Yorkshire and begins to find her way and to investigate the mysterious crying in the night. Who wouldnt love Dickon with the orphaned lamb, young fox, tame squirrels, and ability to charm most animals? The second half of the book feels more dated in its repetitive preachy-ness about Magic. Still, every young reader needs to learn when to savor every word and when to skim along so this is not a bad opportunity to skim. The book is still something that a child could enjoy and the message of positive thinking and the benefits of being a polite kind person is still current. The Secret Garden is available for free from Amazon in a Kindle version. I can t give it less than 5 stars because of the special place that it holds in my childhood memories.",2017-10-21,2017

Frances Hodgson Burnett shares some amazing insights into human nature with the reader. My daughter exclaimed at one point, How can Mary see that Colin is spoiled but not see that she was the same at first too? Led to some great discussions for sure! I also thought it was amazing that Burnett at times switches between different third person limited perspectives and we even have some of the events in the garden narrated from the point of view of the robin! Such clever writing!

Some reviewers complained about the fact that many of the characters speak with a Yorkshire accent and Frances Hodgson Burnett wrote it phonetically the way the characters pronounced the words. I thought it added to the fun! I tried to speak with the broad Yorkshire accent as I read it out loud and changed my voice for the different characters. My daughter and I both loved it. The Yorkshire dialect was interesting and we have been trying to throw some of the words we learned into conversation such as wick meaning alive or lively.

5.0,0001945424,"I hadnt read The Secret Garden in ages, but when my book club decided to study it for characterization, I was more than pleased to pick it back up again, so to speak. Often when Ive gone back to re-read something from my past, I find that I don't think it as impressive or enjoyable, but that was not the case with this book. Yes, I see the characters, setting, and plot in an entirely different way, but I still thoroughly enjoyed the read.

Since my book club wanted to focus on characterization, thats what Ill mention in this review.

At the beginning of the story I felt sorry for Mary. The author paints a perfect picture of neglect. Though Marys parents are wealthy and shes cared for, she is sickly looking because no one really shows her love and nurturing. When tragedy makes her an orphan, the saddest part wasn't the death of her parents, to me, it was that everyone else had forgotten about her. As much as I felt sorry for Mary, I also found her annoying, but I think all kids have that certain, signature youthful trait that lets them bother you to know end without you ever considering not caring for them. As an adult, I realized that as a child, I didn't recognize that Marys parents were a special breed of selfish that you can never have too little of.

I liked how the moors seemed almost like another character in the story. Its quite mysterious to the plain and simple Mary whos never seen such greenery and fog. Then of course theres the garden with all its magic and wonder. Just like the animals that Dickon cares for, the garden is nursed back to life and then pays it forward (like a character) by being a haven and friend to the children. The transformation of the moor, the garden, and the children all parallel so well that its difficult to separate them as individual events.

Theres no great mystery as to why the Dickon character is so loved. Hes an animal charmer and often the center of what the children call magic. Plus, hes just likable. As a kid, I think I too thought the magic was real. As an adult, I still wonder about the voices Craven hears that eventually bring him home to his son Colin. While He has neglected Colin in a similar fashion that Marys parents did with her, hes not completely absent from his life. He loves him, fearfully and from afar, and most importantly never forgets about him.

Ill admit that to this day Im still not overly fond of the Colin character, but I do appreciate his circumstances a little more. Its not his fault he is the way he is at the beginning, but I still feel like he enjoyed it too much. He somehow found power in holding his death over other peoples heads. I was almost relieved, when re-reading this story, to see Colin grow out of his young raja persona, but I still feel like he was a little prince at the end.

I could go off about the actions and behaviors of the servants and adult characters in this book, but Ill simply mention that it reminds me of modern day Disney channel programming where all the kids are smarter and wittier than the adults. Not necessarily good or bad.

All in all, Id say The Secret Garden is good at developing characters as the story progresses. Being able to experience an intimate and personal evolution is a powerful technique that leaves characters in your mind long after youve finished their story. Highly recommended to fans of the classics, children, and anyone looking to read a good book.",2017-07-26,2017

5.0,0001945424,"I never read The Secret Garden as a child, nor any of Frances Hodgson Burnetts books. Now in my second childhood, this was, therefore, my first encounter and I enjoyed the read even if there are failings from a writers perspective in the 21st century.

However, as I started reading I found the descriptions and characterisations were pulling me into a secret world. The author had a way of using short phrases to capture a sense of the characters and settings. Maybe the technique would be hard to replicate today, but it worked in the context of the novel and the period in which it is set. This was a time before the First World War for both characters and author. This may explain a certain innocence that two world wars dispelled.

Locked into the words and images, I was drawn deeper into Mary's world and her explorations. Robin was a cute character that felt almost human in his mannerisms. Some might say anthropomorphic - Anthropomorphism is the attribution of human traits, emotions, and intentions to non-human entities  but for me, the characteristics fitted the bird I knew from growing up in England. He becomes the character that unlocks the secret garden and the healing that Mary and others need.

When she was in the garden, I could see it and sense it. Some might feel that Dickon is unreal and yet he came alive for me, first in what his sister Martha said about him and then when Mary met him. Ive been lucky that I have known a few special people like him and the character echoed memories of those that have a rapport with wild animals.

When Mary found the source of the crying, the book added another character and another level. Damaged characters and healing is a theme from the start of the novel, but its the secret garden thats the catalyst. I liked all the interactions between the characters, and the use of mirror images that Mary and others must face to grow.

When Spring arrived, there was magic is in the air. That is what makes this book work for me and why I suspect that it still survives alongside other childrens classics. Frances Hodgson Burnett captures that feeling of magic that in many ways exist in the natural world around us. There are elements that felt wrong to me reading in 2017, but omniscient POV, idealised social situations, and outdated attitudes were, unfortunately, the norm when the novel was written so they didn't spoil my enjoyment  just deducted one star as a writer with a conscience. But that star magically re-appeared.",2017-07-01,2017

4.0,0001945424,"So I wanted to read my 6 year old some classics.  I had never read this one myself so let me warn you:

The little girl is a victim of some seriously horrific parenting.
The racism is atrocious. (Obviously written in a different era)
Both parents and most of the household die in the first chapter.  This may be difficult for some children.  My son has first hand experience with death in our family, so he probably understood the horror of what happened better than another child might.

There is a bit of a language barrier so we had to modify a bit because not all of the words have the same meaning as today. (Queer)

In the end, I read more of this than my son listened to, but neither of us finished it.  I think we will eventually, and it is fascinating, just know it will need some serious side discussions you may or may not be ready to have if you are reading it to a young child.

Now I can appreciate the serious racism, the sad child(ren) neglect, the rather pagan awakening to nature (clothed as ""Magic""), and the joyous, if obvious, ending. I believe the writing was very good for its time, and had no problem with the Yorkshire dialect. Mary and Colin and Dickon all struck me as very believable characters, and the changes wrought in Mary and Colin were overall pretty credible, although they happened a bit too quickly.

5.0,0001945424,"""According to the early morning farm report, cotton-pickers are already in big demand this spring throughout the Sun-belt, especially in the Mississippi Delta region,"" said Colonel Korn.
  ""Of course, you're referring to the large, complex agricultural harvesting machinery made of iron and steel that plucks cotton-balls from the tall, dried-out looking, stick-like plants, undoubtedly devoid of chloraphyl, which have been grown in vast field acreages; extracts and separates out the seeds; then bales the cotton, weighs it, determines moisture content, and transports it to nearby climate-controlled sheds, for temporary storage until further transportation onto commercial railroad cars is made, I presume,"" replied R. Royce.
  ""Yes, exactly!"" said Korn.  ""Furthermore, I predict a futures bonanza for that particular commodity in the coming months.""
  Dancing around the room, Royce spontaneously burst into song and merriment, singing parts of a lively tune he must have heard on the radio a long time ago that had been stuck in the farthest recesses of his brain, escaping only now:
  ""When I was a little biddy baby my mama used to rock me in my cradle,
  In them old cotton fields down home.
  We used to live in a run-down shack, just about a mile from the Frisco track,
  In them old cotton fields down home.
  When those cotton balls turn rotten, you can't pick very much cotton,

  ""A folk legend is born.  I wish I had a banjo.  Do you know the words to 'Sixteen Tons' by Ernie Ford? You must be feeling down-right sentimental, even nostalgic,""  Korn chimed in, smirking and carrying-on a little despite himself and his normally reserved demeanor.""
  ""I may not be able to sing like Johnny Cash, but three months on special assignment to an undisclosed, isolated, uninhabited, and remote tropical island, reportedly located somewhere in the South China Sea tends to make you appreciate home,"" Royce said.
  ""We should count our blessings that our next stop isn't a quaint and tidy little garden spot located within the Arctic Circle somewhere north of Korea,"" said Korn.
  ""All God's children get weary when they roam. Don't it make you want to go home, Lord?  Don't it make you want to go home?"" sang Royce, a ""Joe South and the Believers"" tune.  ""But, now you're talking Politics!"" he said, as a matter of fact.
  They continued to maintain camouflaged and black-out conditions, with strict radio silence.  Royce monitored some satellite imagery instruments.  Korn checked the cameras strategically placed on the surrounding perimeter.  They were prepared to react quickly and move at a moment's notice.
  ""Quiet!  Don't look now, but we may have a visitor,"" said Korn, observing a live-camera feed.  As the intruder approached, he recognized a friendly, familiar reconnaissance scout.  Evidently, Special Forces had sent them a message from ""the Pueblo"" to be hand-delivered in person.  Their immediate future would hang in the balance.
  ""Code-name 'Amelia Erhardt' at your service,"" stated Major Thomas frankly, an Army Ranger and pilot, her flashing eyes beaming like a lighthouse beacon, her golden-blonde hair neatly cut into the style of a French Poodle, as she calmly and softly stepped into the grass hut, which had long served as their hidden lair, through an open door-way.
  ""Greetings, Meghan!  What's a nice girl like you doing in a place like this?  Good news first. "" specified Royce.
  ""Looking for Livingston, naturally.  What are you guys doing here?  The good news:  you were voted least likely to go out in a blaze of glory back at HQ."" she said.  ""Just kidding.  I really came to see you.""
  At this juncture of the dialogue, Korn cheerfully contributed a few heart-felt chorus lines from 'Ring of Fire' to the conversation.  ""Hallelujah, amen!"" he concluded, with a meek smile.  He innocently offered up a sigh of relief.
  ""You two really know how to defuse a situation and reduce the tension in the room,"" said Royce.  ""What's the bad news?""
  ""You've been scheduled to observe an air-assault and demolitions exercise up close and personal.  But, if you'd rather do Karaoke, we can talk about 'Time Love and Tenderness,' said Meghan.  Or, you can tell me all about  'When a Man Loves a Woman.'""
  ""Mission top-secret, destination unknown,"" replied Royce.
  The Secret Garden, a novel by Frances Hodgson Burnett, was first published in 1911.  The delightfully charming story about three young children, Colin, Dickon, and Mary possesses all of the endearing qualities to become a timeless classic of English literature.
  The children have banded together and become friends in an idyllic, pastoral setting.  Due to the severe limitations imposed upon them by a sometimes rather harsh human existence, they attempt to rise above their circumstances in life.  Despite having sustained grievous injuries, they soon learn that they must persevere if they are to overcome adversity.  They must make a gallant effort to negotiate the obstacles and pit-falls which they encounter along the path toward achieving their goals.  Often, they succeed only through sheer determination and pure will-power.  Because of the process of evolution, which obviously must be at work somehow in their universe--or perhaps because of other, even more powerful forces, there is an almost sublime interaction among the characters in their rite of passage.  The trio reminds me of the plight of the Tin-Man, the Straw-Man, and Dorothy in ""The Wizard of Oz.""  Indeed, their growth and personal development seems to involve a great many ordeals of mind over matter.  Hence, the story actually appears to portray the triumph of the indomitable human spirit.  Moreover, the theme of a ""Garden of Eden"" or ""Paradise,"" running throughout the story as a ""common thread"" reveals the magic and majesty that is commonly known as ""Mother Nature.""  So, above all, the story is a celebration of  Life, which simultaneously expresses deep reverence for the Divine Creator, who is the Author of all Beings.  Ultimately, you can't help but exclaim what you must have heard repeated over the years, time and time again:  ""They grow up so fast, don't they?""",2017-04-25,2017

There's just the right balance of warm fuzziness and conflict, and the characters were well-developed.

As for this particular purchase, it is a very unsatisfactory  edition, poorly laid out, cheap paper, the very few illustrations are  nasty black and white photocopys that are extremely small and dark.

I had downloaded the Kindle book a while ago and when I logged on to Audible, I found I could get the audiobook for free since I had purchased the corresponding Kindle book. I am quite glad that I read the book. I added it to my list of books to read before you die. It quite an uplifting story and would be great for anyone to read.

The story follows 10 year old Miss Mary. She grew up in India with her parents until cholera wiped out her household. When she was little, she was raised by her nurse and was given anything she wanted. Everyone had to listen to her and do what she said. So when everyone was gone, she didn't really know what to do. She was sent to live with her uncle in England. Her uncle was very hands off and left her to her own devices. Between her maid, the housekeeper, and a gardener, she slowly transitions from a spoiled, bored, sickly child to a rather independent, lively child who enjoys gardening. She is encouraged by everyone to spend as much time outdoors to improve her health and strength. She meets Dicken, her maid's brother who has a strong affinity for animals and talking to him helps her see the world differently. She finds her way into a garden that has been shut-up and hidden for a decade. Between her and Dicken they begin to bring the garden to life and the changes they make there begin to reflect themselves in the spirits and health of the young ones. Mysterious crying in the house leads to a new discovery the helps to bring the magic of the secret garden completely to life.

I think the story is a great message to everyone. It teaches about the importance of not being spoiled and lazy. It shows acceptance of disabilities and illustrates the power of thoughts. I found the story to be highly enjoyable and engaging. The writing was simple and fun to read. The language was not extremely difficult but it did provide vocabulary that most children now-a-days do not hear very often. It is also told from the child's point of view so it will be very easy for children to relate to. Even as an adult, I was able to connect with the story. The simple lessons taught throughout that I mentioned before are relevant even to an adult's life and it helps to see the world through their eyes. I highly recommend this book if you have never read it before.",2017-01-12,2017

Whatever though, it doesnt really bother me since Im not a collector and I just wanted a copy to read. Only I wouldve bought the hardcover had I known what I was truly going to get, because the hardcover had illustrations apparently. Either way, its a classic and Im looking foreward to reading the whole thing! Only I cant bring it anywhere because its probab the heaviest book I own.

Having them all in one volume does make them a bit more difficult to read through, since the single volume is quite large to hold. But it is a great way to have multiple copies for multiple kids. The covers do get mangled pretty easily and end up ripping off. The story, of course, is fantastic and completely a must read. This particular format is problematic. I think if I had to do it over again I would buy a boxed set (which I have bought two or three times- these are very well read books around here).

2.0,0001844423,"I had read these as a child and loved them.  Reading them with my daughter, I was both delighted (to share an experience of my youth) and also, increasingly, appalled.  It isn't the religion that bothers me... but Lewis comes off as something of a crank even by the standards of his time: dumb characterizations of reformist trends within his own society, casual racism, and - again even by the standards of the time - a remarkable sexism.  I'm not talking about the big stuff that is the focus of articles; rather the casual comments about ""boys are like this...; girls are like that...""  This isn't simply the novels being of a different time.  It was shockingly regressive even when it was written.

Was my daughter excited about the talking animals?  Yes, but the truth is the prose is pretty awful, the descriptions long (at least for a six year old), and the models of virtue pretty awful by any standards (and, as it happens, I'm fairly conservative and raise my family accordingly).  A ""classic""?  I suppose, but not one that I would recommend",2017-11-15,2017

I know this is a work of children's fiction but it captivated me from the get go (this ""child"" is in his 6th decade). If you've never read any or all of the series then this is the way to get them, unless of course you can afford the set of hardback editions. If you are a fan of fantasy you will not be disappointed.

5.0,0001844423,"I loved it. If you were familiar with any of the Narnia series, either in book form or movie, then you would understand that the series is an allegory of the life of Christ (Lion Witch and the Wardrobe) and how His message affects Christians in their earthly journey. Well, ""The Last Battle"" is an allegory of the battle at the end of the Thousand year reign of Christ, and the recreation of heaven and earth at the end of the book of Revelations. It is C. S. Lewis' view of the falling of the stars out of the heavens and the destruction of the earth by fire that makes phenomenal reading.. As allegories go, Lewis is able to destroy Narnia as he envisions the destruction of heaven and earth and the creation of a new heaven and new earth, which is not boring at all. It allegorically explains who the opposition to the rule of Aslan is, and the kind of deceptions  the anti-Christ and false prophet.will use to woo people to unbelief.

Not a children's story by any means, although it can be read and appreciated by children of all ages.

5.0,0001844423,"I am Shere Khan the Tiger.

  The reason why I called this novel predictable is because I have already seen the 2008 film version of Prince Caspian, which I thought was a fantastic movie by the way. Many times do I enjoy reading books after seeing the theatrical live action version of it to compare and differentiate between the two. This novel had about the same fast pace, amount of darkness and suspense that the film had. Obviously there is only so much they can do when making a film based off of a book to make it accurate.

  That being said, there was much more focus on the character of Prince Caspian in this novel than in the film, that is usually something you 'd expect from books. I hope I won't get any backlash from book fans or even Narnia fans but I actually thought the movie was a lot more in depth than the books, not to mention had amazing action all throughout. Like I said before, you'd expect the contrary. The film contained more sequences to develop all the characters rather than just Prince Caspian, that is something the entire book focuses on most than anything else.

In my personal opinion, the film was a lot more in depth, but hey sometimes that is necessary to expand a little bit more than having your characters look one dimensional. Now I'm not gonna spend all my time saying negative points about it. The fourth installment in the Chronicles of Narnia series, Prince Caspian, thanks to the brilliance of C.S. Lewis, continues to bring the magic of Narnia to life right out of the pages.
You have all sorts of great characters in the novel that keep you at your seat's edge such as the Pevensie children, Caspian himself, the Majestic Aslan, Reepicheep, etc. and it makes you want to keep on going. For fans of the Chronicles of Narnia series or any fan of fantasy adventure novels, I'd highly recommend this novel for them because I know they'd enjoy it greatly.",2017-02-21,2017

To me, it still gives hope, and I thoroughly believe that anyone without an imagination is doomed to living a life of misery and dullness. I would recommend reading this set in the order written, not the current numbered order.  One needs to experience Narnia from The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe first;  then once The Magician's Nephew is read it  fills things in nicely. If you were to read the later first, it would likely not leave the writer with as much fulfillment of filling in things as it does when read later.",2017-01-28,2017

Each book/cd set has 4 discs; 2 or 3 will be mislabeled such that any disc, be it 2, 3 or 4 will have some other data information.

At first he was disappointed when he started the first book because it doesn't have the characters from the movie, but I urged him to give them a chance and that it does tie in with the other stories. He just finished the first book the other day and said he really liked it after he gave it a chance and he was just starting the next book.

I simple could not get past the first 50 pages. In fact, I wanted to abandon it by page 10, but I pressed on because I felt that I was at fault. Such a famous writer simply could not be the one to blame. At any rate, I finally gave up. Part of the reason was the dragging on of the description of a blas family life.

3.0,0002007215,"I'm torn with this one. I'm normally drawn to the darker thrillers and novels with an unreliable narrator but I found it difficult to gel with this novel. The subject matter is dark, gritty and violent but ultimately it is a thriller about guilt and redemption. Grey herself was an interesting character, I liked her sense of containment and detachment but I didn't like her particularly or the choices she had made.

My major issue was the lack of real characterisation with any of the characters with the exception of Madame Strawberry, the owner of the club in Japan where Grey works.

I haven't read this author before and I did like the ""idea"" of the story and the setting but it was a bit of a miss with this reader.",2017-01-01,2017

Interesting that early editions met with moral indignation from some christians, so the Archbishop of Canterbury wrote a Foreword for the 2005 edition.

I bought it as I was on the Kindle version page and it said it had a very high score, almost perfect. When I opened it in my Kindle Paperwhite, it came as 2 pages in 1... impossible to read.

I have come back to the page and read the reviews. To my surprise, all reviews are mixed up... not only the Kindle version, but original movie, new movie, someone reading a book (tape recording), original books, fake books, second hand books, books with bubble gums inside or torn pages.

What is this? Reviews should be separated to correspond the product you ARE buying. So if I wish to buy the Kindle version I should ONLY see the reviews for the Kindle version and nothing else.

I will now contact customer support to get my money back. I have never been so disappointed   with Amazon as last night.
