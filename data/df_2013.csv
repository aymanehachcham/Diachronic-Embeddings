I just wanted to share it with my kids, who appreciated it even though most of them are teenagers now. The story is light-hearted and silly, but with a very powerful message about learning to live with the problems you have instead of trading them for larger problems.

The artwork is hysterical, too.",2013-10-08,2013

Custard the Magic Dragon was read over and over and he still remembers it to this day.  It's a charming mix of poetry, rhymes and stories in verse.

5.0,0001061240,"This is a favorite childhood book of mine.  I hunted it down after getting married in hopes of reading it to my children someday.  It's filled with wonderful classic poems.

It has some funny, witty poems but it doesn't have many of the ""silly"" slapstick style poems that are so common in kids poetry to day.  While some may see that as a liability, I think it's a great thing to expose kiddos to good literature from a young age.  If all kids digest is junk food, they will get fat.  If all they read is silly, slapstick poetry they will have a harder time appreciating classic stuff later on.",2013-03-06,2013

5.0,0002005263,"Officer Bernadette Manuelito is a good investigator  intrepid, clever and resourceful. But it's these very qualities that seem to get her in difficulties. Now she's no longer a cop working for Sergeant Chee at Shiprock. Partly to forget Chee, who's failing to get romantic, she takes a job on the Mexican border. There she encounters some shady characters and dicey situations on a mysterious ranch stocked with exotic game animals.

Chee meanwhile is occupied with a mysteriously well-dressed unidentified dead body. Leaphorn too gets involved in this case.  But neither is too busy to worry about Bernie and get involved in her complications.

Bernie gets a quick education on border patrolling, and so do we. There is a wonderfully despicable villain in the plot, and an unexpected hero.

Chee's best friend Cowboy Dashee also plays a role. He's an Apache and prone to poke fun at Navajos, the heredity enemy of his tribe. His quips are always amusing.

The Leaphorn and Chee mysteries are consistently delightful, with clever plots, tense action, engaging characters, terrific atmosphere, and always a fascinating picture of Native American culture in New Mexico.

But I will add that my husband, a fellow Hillerman fan, found this book a bit weak with the contrivance of too many coincidences. I also read in a book by Anne Hillerman that The Sinister Pig gave Hillerman the most trouble of all his books, because he was less familiar with the location. I love these books so much that I'm not critical of the contrivances. But see what you think.",2013-12-21,2013

3.0,0001384198,"This book is small. Picture a small book in your head... its smaller than that. But that doesn't factor into my star rating. Because they do list its size and its mentioned in other reviews.

I bought this book because my son loves trains (2 years old) and I remember loving this story of never give up as a child. Its our family motto ""nothing worth having is easy to get"" -keep trying and believe in yourself. This was not the book I was looking for. Apparently, I was looking for ""pony engine"" but that's still not the product's fault.

The issue with the book is it makes all boy trains bad. I won't let my daughter (5 years)  read it either nor my son. Messages are important no matter how stuble it creeps into their brains. When perhaps they are older I will let them read the book as an example of how unfair and ridiculous it is to vilify a whole gender. I admits t to over thinking ot.

5.0,0001381733,"Amazon seems to have grouped the reviews for several editions of A Child's Garden of Verses together, so it's difficult to tell what exactly is being reviewed.  I am commenting specifically on Tasha Tudor's lovely illustrations of childhood life, so beautifully paired with Robert Louis Stevenson's poetry of childhood.  Together, image and word are a perfect match, and this is a marvelous edition.  I highly recommend it as a gift for any new parent, a special child, or for yourself.

I live with my grandfather, who was born in 1922 and grew up having these poems read to him and then reading them for himself; when he grew up and had children of his own, he read from this book.  They were a little bit ""old-fashioned"" when my grandfather was a boy in the 1920s, but not at all ""dated"" in the way some of them have become.  I am thinking here of ""Foreign Children,"" with its refrain:

Little Indian, Sioux or Crow,
Little frosty Eskimo,
Little Turk or Japanee,
O! don't you wish that you were me?

There are others in a similar vein, and while I am sure that some will object, I find all of these poems to be utterly lacking in malice or cruelty.  They espouse the ideology of their time, and that was one of Empire.  If you don't want to read the few of these poems that mention race/ethnicity in a way that you don't like, then don't -- or better yet, how about using it as a teachable moment to discuss the ways in which views evolve over time?

The majority of these poems feel timeless, in that they dwell in the land of childhood imagination.  Just reading ""The Land of Counterpane"" sends me right back to the world of childhood and the hours and hours spent dreaming, creating, imagining.  Likewise, ""The Land of Nod.""  I know my grandfather feels just the same way, because sometimes when I tuck him in for bed at night we discuss where we plan to travel in our dreams: the Land of Counterpane or the Land of Nod.  Very few things are capable of staying with a person for 80 + years; these poems are some of them.

If you have children, or know any children you particularly like, I hope you will purchase a copy of this lovely book for them.  It's one of those books that opens a door into another world, and what the child chooses to do once there is up to him or her -- but you can give the key to the door.",2013-07-20,2013

It is more like an encyclopedia of cell biology. It is not very student friendly. This is more like for a grad student class where you already know all these concepts and just need a quick refresher.
My professor idolizes the book author and all the scientists that won the nobel for comming up with these concepts, but that does not help me understand the material.

Book author: Please write more clear and with less jargon. I am an undergrad for god sakes! Im not a cell biologist or biochemist yet.
Pictures are nice but the professor did not tested us on the pictures.

5.0,0001950061,"Dr. Seuss takes one of the most historic eras of the twentieth century and transforms it into one of life's lessons that may appeal to young and old.  The Butter Battle Book was first published in 1984 during the latter part of the Cold War of the mid 1980s.  The story involves two communities, the Yooks and the Zooks, and what can they possibly be in conflict with?  The right and wrong of spreading butter on a piece of bread, the Yooks argue that butter should be spread on top of the bread while the Zooks believe it should be spread on the bottom side of the bread.  What arises after each cannot come to a consensus?

The entire premise of the story involves building new inventive concoctions to deter the opposing group.  As all of this is going on within each side, the Yooks and the Zooks simply cannot see an end to the conflict.  Instead, they continue to build and build bigger walls and massive machinery with the attempt that one will give up.  However, neither side gives in.  And as one reads the story, one of the resolutions that neither side even attempted, a peaceful means of negotiation through communication and speaking with each side rather than producing more unnecessary inventions that simply have not worked.  So where does the story end?  Where it began.

The Butter Battle Book is one of Dr. Seuss's classic stories that falls within the same vein as other controversial storylines that speaks to the masses and offers a lesson, The Lorax.  This story also leaves much room for further discussion almost twenty years after it was written as well as within the present day.",2013-07-12,2013

5.0,0002051850,"Can a whole life be lived in just four days? This is the question that haunts Robert Jordan throughout FOR WHOM THE BELL TOLLS. Leaving behind his respectable life as an American college Spanish-language teacher, he has become an accomplished guerrilla fighter and explosives expert fighting for the anti-fascists in the Spanish Civil War. Can he really find a new ""family,"" fall head over heels in love, and strike a blow that will further the rebel cause and lay his own personal ghosts to rest ... in just four days? Well, he's going to give it one almighty try, because when that fourth day arrives, he is sure there will be no tomorrow.

And so, Robert Jordan, ordered to blow up a bridge to enable the anti-government forces' latest attack, attaches himself to a ragtag band of hardened guerrilla fighters, currently hiding out in a cave in the hills near the bridge. In the cave, he finds a band of unstable, hotheaded misfits, a band of unique and beguiling individuals, a band that is sheltering a frightened ""little rabbit."" But they are very few, and the task Robert Jordan has brought them is very great. Can he possibly lead them to a glorious, unlikely success, or will he lead them to their doom and his own? The story is haunted by the concept that: ""Whether one has fear of it or not, one's death is difficult to accept."" This is the scene that Hemingway sets, and being Hemingway, all he does is tell us: These are the people, this is what happened to them, this is what they did, this is what they said. And being Hemingway, that is more than enough.

Hemingway's famously ""economical"" style can sometimes border on the cold, clinical, and flat, but in this book, he loosens the reins just slightly, with very effective results. The moments of fast-paced action are often very dialogue-driven; in quieter moments, there are little oases of slightly more wordy descriptions of surroundings or feelings; and sensual moments are a tumbling bundle of words and images that hardly even constitute sentences at all, but are intensely moving. Overall, the style of FOR WHOM THE BELL TOLLS is still characteristically Hemingway - matter-of-fact, pointed, with not a word out of place. The dialogue is still jarringly clipped, but that's what makes it so stirring. There are moments of maddening, excessive repetition, but they are like hammer strokes driving the point home. Once again, Hemingway does everything that should make a story fall flat - but instead, it soars. Don't try this at home, folks. This is something beyond the powers of mere mortals; this is something found only in the realms of genius.

Characterization and character development are particularly strong in FOR WHOM THE BELL TOLLS. In his usual way, Hemingway introduces us to all the characters of the story in situ, withholding any hint of their histories and making us earn the right to know them better by waiting and dwelling with them for some considerable time first. It seems that we are meant to get to know these characters in the present so as to deserve the privilege of knowing anything about their pasts, and so as to understand that the present is really all that matters. But by the time we have got to know them that well, all we can think about is their futures: Who will survive the dangerous mission before them?

Robert Jordan is the typical Hemingway leading man - mysterious, enigmatic, physically and emotionally strong but not invulnerable. Initially appearing to be made of stone, it is the ""little rabbit,"" Maria, a victim of unspeakable war crimes who has found refuge with the guerrilla band, who steadily chips away at ""Roberto's"" facade to reveal the human being beneath. And this human being is all too mortal and all too susceptible to the dread of leading his new Spanish ""family"" to their doom. And the enigma remains: Why is this American fighting in somebody else's war? Meanwhile, the cast of peripheral characters in FOR WHOM THE BELL TOLLS is as vibrant and varied as the contents of a paella. In the wait for zero hour, these characters are revealed one by one: Anselmo, the gentle-hearted ""old man""; Fernando, the pedant; Agustin, the fervent revolutionary; Rafael, the unreliable gypsy. And then there is Pilar, a character who could never be accused of being ""peripheral."" Mercurial, certainly, but never peripheral: she is surely one of Hemingway's strongest female characters - by turns worldly, zealous, kind, cruel, loyal, bitter, and as tough as old boots. When it comes to the crunch, we are right there with these very real characters as they march with their heads held high and their hearts in their boots into the impossibly dangerous situation devised for them by the powers-that-be, the powers-that-should-damn-well-know-better.

FOR WHOM THE BELL TOLLS is reminiscent of Hemingway's other war story, A FAREWELL TO ARMS, in the attention it gives to the way in which war turns men into monsters. Pilar's recounting of the first day of the revolution in her own village plus the underlying threat of insurrection within the guerrilla band's own ranks provide chilling evidence of the evil that lurks in the souls of ordinary men and women. In the memorable words of Agustin, ""War is a bitchery."" Robert and Anselmo, in particular, struggle throughout with the Machiavellian concept of killing for the sake of their higher cause. Is this really all there is to it, or do they take some kind of perverse pleasure in the taking of a life? And can they be honest enough, at least with themselves, to admit it?

These themes of personal guilt and responsibility lead inevitably to contemplation of who the enemy really is. At one point, Robert remarks that one side of a revolution usually garners greater attention than the other. Hemingway makes it abundantly clear, however, that FOR WHOM THE BELL TOLLS is not going to perpetuate this injustice, and great pains are taken to emphasize that ""the enemy"" are people, too. From the personal effects of an enemy scout to a peek through the window at the occupants of an enemy guardpost to actual narrative space given to the enemy in a bloody skirmish, the reader is never allowed to forget that both sides of the conflict share a common humanity. When all is said and done, Robert reflects on that part of himself that is the core of all soldiers, no matter who they fight for: ""In him, too, was despair from the sorrow that soldiers turn to hatred in order that they may continue to be soldiers.""

And when faced with the horrors of war, the minds of soldiers often turn to religion, another central theme of FOR WHOM THE BELL TOLLS. Robert and his newly Communist comrades are supposed to have renounced religion altogether, and there are many jokes about their now ex-Lord and Savior. Anselmo, however, is quietly wracked with uncertainty over renouncing the beliefs of a lifetime, and in a particularly moving scene, he wishes for the opportunity to undertake some form of religious penance, once the war is over, for the lives he has taken. And when the battle for the bridge is finally waged, both sides turn to prayer as their last resort.

FOR WHOM THE BELL TOLLS is a magnificent rendition of the hypocrisy, farce, and senselessness of war. This, in itself, makes the book a superb, thought-provoking, soul-searching classic. But it is also arguably Hemingway's greatest love story. Robert and Maria's story is so much more than just a whirlwind romance, it is an exquisitely tender, desperately passionate joining of two lost but beautiful souls. As ridiculous as it may sound, Robert and Maria will make you believe that true love can blossom and burn in the space of just four days. This pair would do anything for each other. They want to live a full life together, but they won't hesitate to die for one another, either. Will they have to?

I do not make this statement lightly: FOR WHOM THE BELL TOLLS is the most perfectly paced novel I have ever read. In the beginning, the story chugs along sedately, giving you time to meet and greet your fellow passengers and accustom yourself to your surroundings. In the last third of the book, you start to hear the whistle blowing and feel the story picking up speed. In the last fifty or so pages, you're holding on to this runaway train for dear life. By the end, you've gone past the edge of your seat and are kneeling on the floor praying for these characters, and especially these two lovers, to survive. ""I wish that I were going to live a long time instead of going to die today because I have learned much about life in these four days; more, I think, than in all the other time."" This is Robert Jordan's musing when the battle is finally joined, and it made me realize that I had also learned much about life from the four days, the lifetime, contained in the pages of this unprepossessing, riveting novel. The thing that makes me so passionate about books is that when they're really, really good, they make my eyes sparkle and my heart beat faster. FOR WHOM THE BELL TOLLS held me mesmerized and took my breath away. It is one of those books I will never forget. It is a masterpiece.",2013-12-17,2013

4.0,0002051850,"This 1939 novel is set during the Spanish Civil War, a war that most American know little about.  The hero of this book is Robert Jordon, an American volunteer hoping that this rebellion would make a better world.  He wants to do good and be a hero but whether or not this happens is basically left for the reader to decide.

The book is about his mission to blow up a bridge and the people he meets along the way - Spaniards hoping for a better life and getting caught up in warfare.  Naturally there is a love interest between Robert and Maria, a young woman who had been very mistreated by bad guys and is now seeking refuge with the cave-dwelling freedom fighters of the revolution.

The writing is sparse and meaningful.  The setting is depressing.  People struggle.  People die.  The future looks bleak.

This is fine story, well told.  However I was annoyed by some of the narrative.  Hemingway doesn't uses curses and so the word ""obscenity"" is used where a curse would logically go.  I don't know if this was in only the edition I was reading but I found it very annoying and it broke my concentration.

4.0,000105001X,"This is one of those books that you either embrace wholeheartedly or dislike intensely I think. I read this many years ago and found  myself quite disatisfied with how the story unfolded. However this is my second reading of Jo Clifford/Matilda de Broase the Lady of Hay and I really enjoyed it the second time around.

Matilda was a woman of her time with very few options open to her but how she defied a Prince, gave all for her family and was betrayed by her husband is compelling reading. That is where the strength of the story lies, the medieval aspect, the political intrigue and the love/hate relationship between Prince John and Matilda.

But this book did have it's detractions. I would have liked more explanation for William's course of action, there were major repercussions for Matilda and her family.
The characters depicted in the present weren't as strongly depicted as their alter egos and it was difficult to feel any empathy or sympathy towards them.

Still I very much enjoyed the medieval setting and the story of Matilda de Braose.",2013-11-16,2013

3.0,000105001X,i think this book is similar to  the timetravellers wife as it jumps back and forward  not a real favourite of that type storyline,2013-07-17,2013
4.0,000105001X,"Barbara Erskine's novel LADY OF HAY, in part an historical novel about Maud (or Matilda) de Braose, who had the misfortune of living during the time of King John the Bad (1199-1216), is one of those novels with parallel plotlines.

In 1970s England, we meet 19-year-old Jo Clifford, who has an amazing ability as a subject in a regression hypnosis, when she relives the last, tortured moments of a 13th-century Norman-French woman, whose husband held a great deal of power in the Welsh Marches during the reign of Henry II (1154-1189), and his sons Richard the Lionheart (1189-1199) and King John.

The modern story then jumps 15 years, and we meet 35-year-old Jo Clifford, successful journalist, and as hard-headed as you expect a modern woman to be. She is given an assignment to investigate regression hypnosis, which is a technique that claims to access a person's memory of a past life. Jo initially pooh-poohs the idea, until she becomes a subject herself.

At that point, the medieval story takes off.

I am not alone in finding the medieval story more compelling, primarily because the stakes are so high, giving Ms. Erskine opportunities for building a spine of tension to hold up the story arc.

The modern part of the story was not interesting. The relationship between Jo Clifford and her on-again, off-again boyfriend Nick went round, and around, and around, and while true to life, this spinning of wheels meant that many opportunities for tension were lost.

Nick's brother Sam is cast as the mad scientist, and as a former scientist myself, I wish that Ms. Erskine had eschewed the cliches and dug deeper to have formed a more interesting character. Sam's motivation is not clear, except that he seems to have gone quite mad for no apparent reason. My question was how did we get from the concerned young man we glimpsed in 1970, to the out-of-control sadist in 1985? No satisfactory answer is given.

The modern story deserves 3 stars, the medieval story deserves 5 stars, so I am giving this novel 4 stars.",2013-07-17,2013

Even though it is a huge book I have read it twice and will likely read it at least once more.

I liked the story, generally speaking.  It was well thought out and fairly well portrayed.  But honestly, I would rather have just had the story about the woman in the past.

I got the kindle version of this book and cover is different so don't be surprised if kindle editions looks different from this.  A caveat.  Now on to the book.  The main protagonist, Jo lives in the current time as Jo and in the past as Welsh Lady named Matilda.  She jumps in the past and the future pretty seamlessly and the author, Barbara Erskine, seems to be adept at carrying on two love triangles, or squares would be more precise but not as phonetically pleasing.  Though I've never been to Wales the writing is good enough to evoke me effortlessly to believe I have been there even though I haven't.  I can imagine it just as I can imagine living 800 years ago in Wales.  This surprised me couple of times and that's what I like, I want to try to guess before the author makes it obvious.  This kept me on my figurative toes.

4.0,000105001X,"I really enjoyed this book.  However, it is a very long book.  It is well written, with a captivating story based on real people.  Jo, a journalist, involved with Nick, her lover, is hypnotised and regresses 800 years into the English and Welsh past.  She is then Matilda, who lived in the time of Henry the 2nd of England.  She is married to William DeBraose, a cruel lord, but is in love with Richard deClare, another noble.

  She travels back and forth through time, eventually recognizing her modern companions from her life in the past. Sometimes she travels through hypnosis, sometimes she regresses spontaneously. The book takes you through some actual events , some imagined.  But it keeps you interested.  I was compelled to look up the characters online, and found them very interesting also.

4.0,000105001X,"This is a rather convoluted story given that you must keep track of both past and present story lines for multiple characters. The characters are compelling by themselves, but when placed into this particular story they become entrancing.

Ms. Erskine was very thorough in researching the material for this book, and the descriptive details were wonderfully enchanting. The only place I feel she slipped a bit was in the way the historical characters spoke, occasionally using the word ""hey,"" which was not introduced into common language until several hundred years after the historical portion of the story took place. And for all that Lady de Baorse was a trailblazer, I still found it a bit challenging to reconcile her attitude and how on the one hand she spoke to men - particularly the king - as if they were equals, and on the other hand she would talk about the duties of women being to submit to their husbands and acknowledging that they were owned by their husbands just like a horse or an item of clothing. But much of that can be forgiven and understood since the Lady de Baorse was being channeled by a modern-day woman who wouldn't be afraid of men as women of the 1200's would be, since women were chattel and only used to gain necessary alliances and such.

That hiccup aside, the story is riveting. All the main characters are strong forces on their own and combined together they become a volatile mix. Even the secondary characters have a surprising depth not often seen in a character that may only be in two or three scenes in the entire book. Just when you feel that the story arc is beginning to drag, you are whisked back in time to relive the extraordinary life of Matilda, otherwise known as the Lady de Baorse. However for the majority of the book the story moves right along at a lovely clip.

If you have an issue with wanton alcohol consumption be forewarned, as I'm not sure if there is a single scene in which either alcohol or coffee is not consumed - and often the coffee contains alcohol. Also, Jo comes across as having a rather loose moral code when it comes to sex, but I much of that is driven by the historical portions of the book oddly enough.

This book is perfect for those who enjoyed such books as 'The Other Boleyn Girl,' 'The Virgin's Lover,' and other books that take historical periods and their more well-known people and try to recreate what their lives might have been like. While that may sound like a simple romance novel it is clear the hundreds of hours of research that goes into the creation of the top-shelf books of this genre. And there is no doubt in my mind that this book belongs up near the top-shelf with the others, though it is not in the same league as the Diana Gabaldon's ""Outlander"" series. Definitely a challenge to put the book down and get anything else done until I finished reading it. Thankfully it is a fairly quick read, regardless of its size.",2013-03-20,2013

5.0,0002005379,"I'm always searching for books for my 15 year old son to read.  My son loved Airborn, and so did I.  This book was for my tastes far better than the typical young adult fare.

First, the story itself is entertaining and creative.  It isn't at all formulaic.  It has a good balance between fantasy and reality.  The era is nearly the same as the early 20th century, but there are enough subtle twists to make the reader suspend disbelief and accept the possibility of existence of strange creatures and undiscovered islands.  For instance, the gas used to make the airships ligher than air is called ""hydrium"".  The metal of the airship is ""alumiron"".  There are continents named ""Europa"" and ""North Americus"".  It's just delightful how Oppel's world in Airborn is almost, but not quite, the same as ours.

Second, this is a really, really well written book.  The writing technique is great.  The mood is consistent and the vocabulary is just right for young adults.  We're told the story from Matt's perspective, and to me his character, that of the female protagonist Kate, as well as the other main characters, are all well developed with just the right amount of introspection.  The descriptions of action are great.  The pace is even, and kept my attention enough that I finished the book in a couple of days.  I've read a lot of young adult fiction, and I really think that Oppel is the best writer for young adults that I've read.

Third, the book is perfect for general audiences.  It shows that you don't need to have a lot of profanity, violence and sex to sell books and interest readers.  My son is a pretty typical teen who likes Eminem, Robin Thicke, South Park, Family Guy, etc.  But he also loved this book.  As a parent, it was great to see my son enjoy a book with a hero who has a sense of duty, works hard and loves his family.  There's no profanity and not much violence (and no graphic violence).  There's certainly romance, but nothing risqu.  One last thing- although the story 's central character is a boy, Matt, I would recommend this book for both boys and girls.  Kate is every bit as interesting and well-developed a character as Matt.",2013-09-01,2013

5.0,0002005379,"There is never a dull moment in Kenneth Oppel's gripping ""steam punk"" novel about airship travel. The story is set in the nineteenth century in a world resembling our own in many ways. The world Oppel creates in this first installment of his trilogy (though the book stands on its own and you don't need to read the other two novels set in the same universe, I bought the second novel as soon as I'd read Airborn's last page). The main characters, sixteen year-old Matt Cruse (a cabin boy on the luxury cruiser Aurora from a modest background who's still coming to terms with the death of his father) and wealthy and feisty Kate de Vries, are sympathetic, well-developed and easy to relate to. Together Matt (at first somewhat reluctantly) and Kate embark on finding out the truth about mysterious flying creatures that Kate's grand-father wrote about in his diary before his death.
Sophisticated world-building, adventure, pirates and a hint of romance make for a very entertaining read, with the potential to appeal to teens and adults alike.",2013-05-25,2013

4.0,0001844423,"I wanted to have all seven Chronicles-of-Narnia books in a single ebook, and that's exactly what this product delivers.

When I pre-ordered this item several months in advance, I was fortunate enough to find it on sale for $12--a real bargain. Upon its release, it was priced at $44.99, which I think is high for a digital box set like this. Fortunately, the price recently dropped to $24.99, which is a decent buy. By comparison, one can currently acquire the seven separate books at $5.98 each and spend just under $42 (not counting any sales tax that might apply). Of course, someone who really wants Boxen (not of interest to me) would still have to get that somewhere else.

Based on the publisher's description of this box set, I was afraid there wouldn't be any illustrations at all. I was pleased to discover that the publisher included one illustration at the beginning of each chapter in each book. The other in-line illustrations found throughout the text of the individual ebooks were omitted in this edition, which is aimed at older readers, according to the publisher. I was glad that at least some of the illustrations were included in this edition. However, since I would have preferred that this edition include all of the same illustrations as the seven separate ebooks, I have taken away one star.

If you are a Narnia fan and, like me, prefer to have collections of related books in a single ebook to reduce the clutter on your Kindle, I recommend this edition--so long as you don't mind that not all of the illustrations are included. If you're an older reader like me and just want a nice, convenient way to re-read the Chronicles of Narnia, this should meet that need quite nicely. However, if you're buying the Chronicles of Naria primarily to read to your children or grandchildren, and you want to show them the illustrations as you go along, I recommend sticking with the individual ebooks, which include the complete illustrations, even though that will likely mean spending more.",2013-11-06,2013

It has all the elements of a great kid story and is told through a whimsical voice that makes the reading colorful.

2.0,0001844423,"While The Last Battle is an interesting and satisfying read in how the end of Narnia and the arrival of most of the major characters in Aslan's country is portrayed,this book has shown a great flaw upon rereadings. We know that Susan is excluded from Aslan's country and is left alive on earth. Some have interpreted her fate as the result of her losing faith in Narnia and others have interpreted her fate as that she was excluded from Aslan's country because she discovered sex/sexuality. Either of those reasons are fair reasons for her exclusion. But here's the problem: the reader is not given any depiction of how she reacted on earth when she learned her parents and siblings had died nor of what her life was like after that. This book is portrayed as having a very happy ending because of Peter,Edmund,Lucy,Polly,Digoory,Jill and Eustace getting to be with Aslan in his own country forever. Yet Susan is just blown off as ""No longer a friend of Narnia."" and no thought or attention is given to the fact that we now have a teenage girl who has lsot both of her parents and all 3 of her siblings at the same time. As they say,death is toughest on the people the dead leave behind. Yet this book trivializes death by giving Susan no shift at all and showing no depiction of what she was like when she learned her parents and siblings had died and what her life was like after that. While the story itself is very good and would rank 4 out of 5 stars by itself,I deduct 2 stars from this novel for trivializing death and the effects it has on those left behind. 2 out of 5 stars.",2013-07-19,2013

In particular,the journey of Eustace of going from being a jerk to being a reformed and redeemed character is splendid. Then there's Reepicheep. Reepicheep's undying belief in the existence of Aslan's Country and his persistence in wishing to see it out along with his sheer nobleness make Reepicheep,apart from Aslan,the strongest animal character in the Narnia series.

4.0,0001844423,"The Narnia novel series got off to an amazing start with the 5 star entries The Magician's Nephew and The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe. Then,The Horse and His Boy was so boring I could never get very far into it. Prince Caspain returned the engrossment the 1st 2 Narnia Novels had. The 1st part of the book,where Peter,Susan,Edmund,and Lucy put together the clues that led them to realize the ruins they had come to had once been Cair Paravel. It's really sad that the movie focused so much on battle scenes and abridged this wonderful story so much. Another fascinating part of the book that the movie sadly gives short shift to is Caspian's history. And then the whole muddle about times is just brilliant! The end of the novel is satisfying but the book does a get a bit slowish in the middle. Still,Prince Caspian is well worth reading and is certainly good enough to excite a reader about continuing the series. Is Prince Caspian the best Narnia novel? No. But it is a worthy addition to an outstanding series. And with the way this book starts,you can just ignore The Horse and His Boy and treat it as though it were a sequel to The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe instead. Peter truly acts like a high king should in this novel and gets along great with Caspian. The movie totally BUTCHERED Peter's character. While the slowness in the middle prevents middle prevents me from giving this book 5 stars,it's still a pretty engrossing story overall and is well worth reading. 4 out of 5 stars.",2013-07-17,2013

Even though it deals with events before The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe (usually considered No. 1), it is more abstract in some of its concepts. Quite profound in its own right.

S. Lewis presents the beginning of Narnia.

Polly and Digory are two children growing up in London around the time of Sherlock Holmes (that is, around 1895) in the same row of houses.  Digory's uncle has been experimenting with Magic and has devised a way to visit other worlds.  Digory and Polly become his guinea pigs to test it out, visiting two worlds: the dying world of Charn, and the newborn world of Narnia.  Along the way we meet the White Witch, the first Talking Animals of Narnia, the first joke, the first Narnian king and queen, and -- of course -- Aslan.  We see how evil first enters Narnia, and we see how that evil is addressed.

Within the Narnian arc, of course, this story is important simply for explaining how Narnia started and why a certain wardrobe acted as it did.  (And why a certain professor in a future story expressed less incredulity than expected, once.)  It may also be interesting for the Biblical stories it's obviously intended to varyingly echo and evoke, blended with classical mythological references.  (On that note, this time reading I noticed that in Narnia it wasn't woman who sinned and offered man the opportunity to sin, but rather man who sinned with the woman at worst egging him on.  I don't think anyone should particularly care about the gender blame game in either instance.  But it is interesting to note nonetheless.)

Outside the Narnian context, the story itself doesn't have as much to recommend it as other Narnian entries do.  Narnia's primal magic is excellent -- a world where anything planted just grows?  including coins, toffee, and lamp-posts? -- and the world feels distinctly and uniquely new.  But other than that, there's not a whole lot to heighten interest.  There isn't an obvious driving question to the story.  (Digory's mother, sure, but she's not mentioned enough to carry that story, or at least wasn't during this read.)  The characters have their own identities, but they exist more to play out the story than to be intriguing themselves.  And the story itself is interesting more along the lines of being informative about Narnia than being interesting so much in its own right.  Plus there are its unaddressed magical loose ends -- what's the nature of the in-between place or the mark, are those green and yellow items good or evil or simply too powerful, and so on -- which are totally unlike the magic in any of the other stories.  Which isn't bad per se, but it's less rationalized than one might want.

Overall, this story is definitely worth reading to get the whole picture of Narnia.  And that's why you should definitely read it.  But on its own it's not as great as some of the entries in the Chronicles of Narnia.

One last topic: for the newcomer to Narnia, what reading order should be followed?  Lewis wrote the stories in one order, but that order is not the chronological one, so a choice must be made.

Chronological order:

Publication order:
1. The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe
2. Prince Caspian
3. The Voyage of the Dawn Treader
4. The Silver Chair
5. The Horse and His Boy
6. The Magician's Nephew
7. The Last Battle

The chronological ordering is more straightforward, but a chronological book may ""spoil"" a later-in-time, previously-published book.  So there are potential concerns with either ordering.

As publication order often coincided with actual order, the only books where caution might be needed are The Horse and His Boy, The Magician's Nephew, and The Last Battle.  The last of these is last in either sequence.  No books after The Horse and His Boy directly refer to it (as best as I recall), so it too may be ignored.  That leaves only this book.

The allusions this story makes to the contents of the other are few: at start explaining that this story would explain how ""the comings and goings"" between our world and Narnia started, and at end to set up the mechanism of The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe.  I don't believe these brief allusions damage those stories.  Knowing that there is a lamp-post in Narnia from this book doesn't really spoil Lantern Waste in The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe, except to prove that that is Narnia.  But a series reader won't be surprised by this, so it hardly matters.  (And even someone not seriously reading through the series doesn't need to know these details -- the story setup primes the reader to expect magical events and explanations.)

In the end, then, I think the chronological order is the right order to read through these stories, if you intend to read them all.  (And you definitely should!)  If you're quite sure you're not reading them all -- but really, they're all short enough and enjoyable enough, that why bother? -- publication order might be reasonable.  But I think there's enough magic to each entry that you might as well still read chronologically.",2013-06-23,2013

5.0,0001844423,"Over 60 years ago, Clive Staples Lewis created and crafted an unforgettable universe known as Narnia. We've discovered it seven times in seven volumes that brought us adventures between good and evil, people and animals, and fantasy and imagination alike. I read all seven volumes last year, and the saga truly deserves to be called one of the best book series of all time. While originally ""The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe"" was the first of the series to be published, ""The Magician's Nephew"" is chronologically the first in the saga. It's also an important volume because it tells us how Narnia was created, how the White Witch was formed, and how two children had an unexpected journey.

It all starts with the accidental meeting between Polly Plummer and Digory Kirke. Polly and her family live in London, while Digory lives with his relatives next door to her. After getting to know each other and spending time in Digory's house, they decide to see his uncle's study room that he's forbidden to enter. While observing the study, the two get a startling appearence from Digory's Uncle Andrew, and then Polly disappears from the study, thanks to the yellow ring that Uncle Andrew  gave to her. He explains to Digory where the ring took her, so now it's up to him to find her and enter a whole new world.

Digory finds himself in a forest, who finds Polly on the ground and tries to jog their memory and then jump in a pool of water with the green rings from his uncle. They suddenly find themselves in the ruins of an abandoned kingdom. The two then find a row of eight royal people in crowns and wearing the finest of royal clothing, sitting still as statues.  After Digory rings a golden bell, the kingdom starts to crumble and awakens one of the royal people, who is a queen, that guides them out just in time. She reveals herself to the two as Queen Jadis, the Last Queen who tells them how their kingdom was destroyed and plans to rule their world, no matter what. Through their journey, Digory and Polly will find many surprises, which include Jadis invading their world, the power of their friendship, and the birth of Narnia.

""TMN"" is no doubt, flawless and outstanding from the beginning to the end and is also my favorite in the series. The novel truly shows readers how the Narnian world was created, as well as two children and their journey, which was the reason. There are many surprises that I couldn't stop reading at all. All the characters in the novel are truly wonderful that they feel so real. The novel does have a few religious moments, especially the creation of Narnia, but it always has a spiritual and whimsical mind. The story is like a fantasy thrill ride that always has excitement. Bayne's illustrations are just dazzling and original, which are truly a treat.

Readers, young and old, will definitely call this book, and the whole series, a classic. While younger readers might be more into reading series like ""Percy Jackson"", ""Harry Potter"", or ""The Hunger Games"", ""Narnia"" is a series that truly appeals to children and will bring them to world of whimsicality. Whether you read the series in order of release date or chronological order, it's up to you. For me, I like reading the series chronologically in order. But for ""TMN"", it's a true classic that brought us Narnia from the very beginning.

Final Verdict: The first novel of the Narnia saga gives us a powerful and unforgettable adventure about two friends brought to a new world.",2013-04-11,2013

3.0,0001844423,"5 stars my kindergarten-aged daughter would loudly give these books. (4 for Reepicheep all by himself...)

4 stars my 10 year old self would have given them, when they were read to me (In chronological order - HORRORS!!!) by a teacher, after recess, every day, from start to finish...

1 star I would have likely given them when I read them, just because, 6-7 years ago.

3 stars I give them, as a parent, who reads to his daughter every night.  Because she likes them, not because they're a joy to read aloud....

Averages out to 3.25 stars.... Moving on now...

From a work of fantasy, for kids old enough to follow the story lines, these are great.
(Though I'm not looking forward to reading the last book to my five year old...)

You've got magical paintings and wardrobes that transport average kids to fantastic places; wonderful creatures like fauns and dryads and elves; talking mice that kick ass;  kids being transported from their mundane real lives to...well...NARNIA, where they have exciting adventures and become kings and queens and good triumphs...

As I wrote the above, I wanted to be able to listen to the stories unfold from the point of view of a small child again.  I bet I'd get a big kick out of them.

But as an adult, reading them for myself, I found Lewis' writing to be dry, at times heavy handed, and perhaps lacking in the tone that one would hope to associate with a writer of children's books about magical kingdoms populated by talking animals and centaurs and giants and wood nymphs.

As an adult, I can roll my eyes a bit at the not-so-subtle Aslan-as-God,stuff.  Really rolled 'em at the end of The Last Battle....
As an adult, reading them to myself, I did not fight against the urge to skim like crazy, when I realized I wouldn't miss anything intrinsic to the storyline by doing so.
I embraced the urge.

As an adult reading them aloud, I find myself editing a bit.  Example from last night at bedtime: Does it negatively impact the story if my five year old doesn't know that the Calormen are dark skinned, cruel turban-wearers?  Of course not.  She's smart enough to get that they're not ""the good guys"", without that description.
Is there a point at all to the stop at the island where they ousted Governor Gumpas?

And I find myself stumbling on occasion as I read aloud, due to Lewis' writing style.  If you need parentheses to explain something that you can't SHOW,something that's usually not that important to begin with.... Don't bother.

But, again, the intended audience for these books is not me. Not middle aged un-relgious guy in 2013.

It's children.
And in that respect, the books succeed, even if I personally think there are better, more excitingly written, alternatives.",2013-04-08,2013

I purchased this book last year for this year's homeschooling with my oldest daughter who is in fourth grade.  I didn't look closely at it when it arrived though.  And I had her complete the first unit for The Magician's Nephew.  I am putting together a unit right now for her that will address all of the story elements, so I went back and took a closer look at this book with that in mind.  I was really disappointed when I realized that all of the questions I read as I skimmed the book were all literal questions.  The author did go beyond yes or no, but not to any deeper level of analysis.  Student simply need to look in the text and write the literal answers to the questions.  There are questions about the setting and characters, but it's all mixed together and the words that one associates with the story elements:  point of view, theme, plot, climax, character development, setting aren't directly used.

5.0,0001844423,"I saw the small episode of C.S.Lewis on PBS during which he met and married. Having been living among ""intellectual"" bachelors, the story, as a true one (1952) was fascinating. They mentioned his ""children's"" book, Chronicles of Narnia. They said very little about them, but marvelled at how this Englishman managed to mesmerize American children (the heathens LOL) as well as those in the UK.
I HAD to get the books.

This series of 7, written from 1950-57, are page turners for this old ""senior"" reader. They are listed in the order in which Jack (C.S.'s nickname) wanted them published, rather than the order in which they were written. From the first 2 which I've read so far, it seems a good choice. The 2nd would not have been as much fun without the first.

I've heard about Narnia all my life, but only one fellow in his 30's had read them as a kid. Amazing, since most of my old friends had been target-age kids at the time. YET, today, I'm enjoying them immensely. I cheated and looked at the last 2 pages of the last book, and one realizes the effect which his life with his American wife, and love, must have had on this author.

Read it!

I'm sure it's where Harry P. got his shoes wet. And...you just might have some ""adventures"" in make-believe...or is it really that simple (not)? And it sure beats the heck out of watching politics these days.

PS: One reviewer mentioned color illustrations!? There are NONE in this paperback, just small simple line drawings here and there. Frankly I want the words!",2013-01-20,2013
5.0,0001844423,"Have you ever wondered where the lamp-post in Narnia came from? Or how it got there? For that matter, how did the evil Jadis get there? Her lineage has no roots in Narnia, so how did she find her way there?

All of these questions and more are answered in *The Chronicles of Narnia: The Magician's Nephew*. As the story begins, two children in turn of the century (19th to 20th) England, Digory Kirke (who will become the professor Kirke of the previous books/future stories) and his friend Polly Plummer, meet on a summer day in London. Digory is crying and dirty because he is so forlorn due to his mother's terminal illness.

It should be mentioned that it is likely that Mrs. Kirke's illness was likely inspired by, if not outright based upon, the real-life death of Lewis's mother when he was a very little boy. Lewis knew suffering, and that comes out in the character of Digory Kirke. The reader's heart breaks for the small boy, as his pain is so vivid.

Their homes are in a section of housing where the individual houses are connected by these areas that connect at the cellar. The two children go to Polly's ""cave"" (really a part of the said section of connected houses) and have all sorts of adventures there. Lewis notes that it is an unusually wet summer, so they have to play indoors instead of outside as children prefer. My how times have changed for the worst, in this reviewer's opinion. Going outside is foreign to kids today.

During one of these indoors adventures, they are making their way through the interconnected sections towards an abandoned house, when they wind up in the attic of Digory's *uncle's house*. This is when the plot is set in motion.

I really can not say much more without giving away too much of the plot. As it stands, some of the book covers give away too much as it is. The story is especially lovely when the creation of Narnia occurs. There are similarities in a broad, mythical context to the creation of the cosmos by Eru in *The Silmarillion*, written by Lewis's friend, J. R. R. Tolkien. The beauty and power displayed in the Creation event really does bring across the idea that Aslan (like God in real-life) is both good and terrible. And He is so unbelievably awesome and unbelievably great for it.

The book doesn't really spend as much time on various theological or moral points as the others do. It's more of a broad mythical statement affirming the Biblical concept of Creation in the Bible. The idea of God's Sovereignty and control over His Creation is abundantly clear and obvious, as is the fact that everything goes according to His plan and will. As Aslan says to to the Narnians, He will make sure the He suffers the most at the hands of Witch's evil.

The above is, of course, a reference to the eventual death and resurrection of Aslan the Lion for the sins and betrayal of Edmund Pevensie in *The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe*. Aslan later warns of what the reader knows to be the Nazis in World War II and the Soviet Union in the Cold War.

While not the overt theological lessons as found in the other Narnian Chronicles, it is a necessary theological point, nonetheless. Too often Christians tend to ignore basic Biblical and doctrinal Truths. This is not a recent phenomenon. It was a problem in Lewis's time as well. It is also worth noting that Lewis tended to come across as believing in so-called ""theistic evolution"" in his earlier writing on Christian Apologetics. He clearly moved away from that to the more Biblical view.

Indeed, another aspect of the book is how science needs moral restraint. Some act like Lewis and Tolkien hated science and technology. They hated the abuses of it. They used technology more often than folks seem to realize, and especially Lewis did. The point about science here is that made in his ""adult fairy tale"" *That Hideous Strength*. To work well, to make discoveries that genuinely benefit all, and not just a few, indeed, to actually work at all, science needs a moral, Christian basis.

There is very little I can find to critique in this story. Lewis beautifully tells a Creation myth, and teaches good moral, political, and historical lessons at the same time. Plus he relates to the reader what the world was like when he himself was a little boy. Digory is basically the same age that Lewis was, and has many characteristics in common with Lewis. I found myself able to imagine what the locales of London and the life of a turn-of-the-century English child would be like. Marvelous writing.

This book is hard for me to rate in comparison to the other *Chronicles of Narnia*, because so much of it is spent in worlds *other than* Narnia, making it inherently different from the other six books. Nevertheless, I must say that it is a beloved book of mine, and I can't say enough good about it.

Highly Recommended.",2013-01-19,2013

Also, there are parts of the book that stick with you, like the scene where we finally get to hear a few desperate words from  oh, lets just say once of the principal characters whom we haven't REALLY heard from until that scene (Sorry to be cryptic, just don't wanna do spoilers). Its scary where its supposed to be scary, and Cichton never talks down to the reader, which I like.

I am so absolutely confused by this book.  I want to hate it but I don't hate it.  It wasn't exactly what I was expecting and I hate it because of that but it's not the books fault because I didn't read the summary.  I thought it was going to be more of a fictional biographical account of exactly what was going on in Nanking but it really wasn't.  It was a suspenseful fiction about an idea of a specific event that happened in Nanking.  I think it would have been a better tale from the eyes of the co-hero than an immature Englishwoman that became obsessed with something she read in the book.

I couldn't put it down but at the same time I was too stressed to turn the page.  I knew it was only a matter of time before something went bad with the gangster, Fuyuki, and before Shujin met a terrible fate.  The main character, Grey, drew me in with her broken soul, making me want to envelope her in a protective hug that deflects all bad things so she has the time to heal.  I feel the book could have done a better job at explaining the connection between her obsession with the live babies being cut out of mothers wombs in Nanking to her own experience of self mutilation to ""save"" her baby.  Chongming, I would love to read an account from his perspective.  About that fateful night in Nanking; about his escaping; about his guilt, sadness, grief; about his quest to find Fuyuki.  I think that would be a most interesting tale but probably gut-wrenching and horrible and sad - even more so than this original one.

Reading about the atrocities committed there, she found a description of something so terrible she had to ask somebody if it were really true. But nobody would believe her when she told them that she read it and she was labeled 'sick', 'twisted' and 'evil'. And the book vanished, leaving her with no evidence to back up her protests.

Ever since then Grey has been obsessed with proving that that atrocity did occur, that she did read about it, and that she is not evil or insane. The story picks up in Tokyo, where Grey's obsession has lead her to an old Chinese university professor who was actually at Nanking, and who may have the only existing video footage of the event. But the professor won't show it to her unless she does something for him in return: get close to a dangerous old Yakuza boss and discover the source of the Chinese folk remedy that is keeping him alive.

The Devil of Nanking is a meditation on evil. The (real) atrocities that occurred at Nanking in 1937 were both horrific and unnecessary. Why did they happen? Was it ignorance, or evil, or both? Is there a difference between ignorance and evil? Grey is obsessed with this question, because she has herself done bad things, but out of a childlike ignorance, not out of malice.

Grey and the Chinese Professor, Shi Chongming, have both been brutalized by the events of Nanking, although in different ways. Its horror colors everyone it touches, even the society of modern Japan, blissfully ignorant (for the most part) of the horrors their people once perpetrated.

Every character in this book has secrets - dark, dark secrets - our two protagonists included. And whether they are evil or just ignorant, the people they are investigating are definitely and unequivocally evil, the kind of evil capable of perpetrating unthinkable crimes: the ancient Yakuza mob boss and his sexually ambiguous Nurse.

Probably nothing I have written about this book so far gives you any desire to read it. But this is one of the most well-written books I have read in a long time. To label it 'crime fiction' or 'mystery' or some other genre is to do it a grave disservice. At times it comes closest to horror, although author Mo Hayder seldom rubs our noses in the details. She seems to belong to the school of writers who prefer to let the reader's imagination fill in the details. Depending on how vivid your imagination is, this may be a good or bad thing.

Certainly this is not a 'feel good' book. But I found it strangely irresistible. The prose is beautifully written and the story is meticulously paced and plotted. Again, this is one of the best-written books I have read in quite some time.

I also think, and I believe that the author would agree, that the historical Rape of Nanking should not be forgotten. The atrocities committed there are on the same level, if not on the same scale, as those of the Holocaust. In a sense, though, they are worse, since no evil dictator or twisted mastermind ordered the Rape of Nanking. It was a disaster without purpose or meaning. But the whole event has been largely buried and forgotten both in Asia and in the Western world.

Hayder's almost poetic prose unearths the story as only good fiction can.

4.0,0002007215,"I bought the Devil of Nanking: A Novel on a whim during Amazon's Kindle deals.  I had never heard of either the book or author.  Sure was glad Amazon brought the book to my attention.

I was hooked from the start.  Loved the heroine, a lost lonely but determined young woman who would do almost anything to uncover the truth about what happened in Nanking after the Japanese occupation.  At the same time, the author places the reader in Nanking starting prior to the Nanking occupation, but after the Japanese started to occupy China.  Through the eyes of a presumed survivor, one gets a clear picture of the disbelief of the possibility that the Japanese could or would be anything but honorable during war.  Wake up and smell the carnage.

This book has it all.  Action, intrigue, a weird ""damaged"" heroine in a strange country.  We get a glimpse into current Asian culture and the Japanese Occupation of China.  Hints of atrocities by the Japanese, superstitions, and the subsequent cover up and burying of the records of the rape, torture and other brutalities inflicted on the Chinese by the Japanese.

We have learned of the Japanese treatment of Americans during WWII but it is hard to imagine the horror and terror inflicted on the Chinese citizens, especially the Women and Children.  At times a hard book to read but only because of the subject matter.  Downgraded one star only because as good as it was, it could have been written somewhat better.  There were a couple times the story seemed bogged down by the details.  Mo Hayder will just get better with time and experience.  All in all a great and solid read.",2013-01-25,2013

5.0,0002117908,"""Social contract"" is a term that is thrown about pretty widely in our society.  People will talk in a casual if sometimes facile manner about the idea that people willingly give up the theoretically total freedom of a state of nature in exchange for the benefits that life in a civilized society provides.  But what Jean-Jacques Rousseau means by the term, as expressed in his classic work ""The Social Contract"" (1762), is much more complex and much more nuanced.

""Man was born free, and he is everywhere in chains"" -- it is on this seemingly paradoxical note that Rousseau begins ""The Social Contract.""  Indeed, there is a contrarian strain to Rousseau's work that is at once infuriating and refreshing.  One gets the sense that Rousseau enjoyed the philosophical challenge of taking on the counterintuitive side of an argument, of expressing whatever might go against the received wisdom of his time.  At the same time, however, one always has a strong sense that the man from Geneva believes deeply in what he says.

Rousseau takes great care in differentiating between the executive and legislative functions of government, just as carefully as he distinguishes between ""the sovereign"" and ""the government.""  Perhaps because I was traveling in Lucerne while reading ""The Social Contract,"" I took particular interest in Rousseau's assertion that small countries were best suited for republican government, as when he writes that democratic government is best suited to ""a very small state, where the people may be readily assembled and where each citizen may easily know all the others"" (p. 113).  Looking at the beautiful little cities of Switzerland, each one sheltered by a cool clear lake at its front and a wall of mountains at its back, I could understand why Rousseau may have thought that such a setting was perfect for successful republican government.  It seems worthy of mentioning, in that connection, that Geneva is still officially ""the *Republic and* Canton of Geneva"" (emphasis mine).  Truly, the Swiss take their independence seriously.  Think about *that* the next time you're in the old section of Zurich, enjoying some cheese fondue and a glass of Chasselas.

How, I found myself wondering, would Rousseau have felt about the United States as an experiment in building a large republic?  When Rousseau wrote ""The Social Contract"" in 1762, the French & Indian War was not yet over, and the idea of American independence from Great Britain was not even on the horizon.  By the time Rousseau died in 1778, the Continental Army had won the battle of Saratoga, and American independence was starting to seem like more of a real possibility.  Did Rousseau ever talk about any of that?  I don't know.

There were plenty of times when I found myself disagreeing with Rousseau.  Among the city-states of classical Greece, he prefers Sparta to Athens, and I could not disagree with him more in that regard.  I also thought that he treated the topic of dictatorship much too lightly and casually, as when he assures us that ""a dictator could in certain cases defend the public freedom without ever being able to invade it"" (p. 172); if he had lived through the 20th century, and had been writing ""The Social Contract"" in, say, 1962 rather than 1762, perhaps he would written about dictatorship quite differently.  But I think Rousseau would have liked having readers disagree with him; for him, that was no doubt an integral part of the dialogue regarding the relationship between the individual and society.

This Penguin edition of ""The Social Contract"" is a good way for a first-time reader of Rousseau to get to know the philosopher and his work.  The preface by British scholar and translator Maurice Cranston does an excellent job of situating ""The Social Contract"" in its social and historical context, and in terms of the biographical facts of Rousseau's life.  Rousseau's reflections on government, on society, on sovereignty (be ready to hear a lot about the ""general will""), are always thought-provoking.  Read ""The Social Contract""; and when you are done reading it, reflect on how you as an individual relate to the society in which you live.  How do you feel regarding the terms of the contract that Jean-Jacques Rousseau says you have signed?",2013-06-07,2013
