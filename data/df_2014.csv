5.0,0001061240,"I don't know that I can truly explain why I like this book so much. Started reading it to my son and daughter in approx 1960. They loved it and so did I like reading it to them. The Book contains a wonderful collection of poetry of many topics and styles, appealing to from toddlers to adults! I think it is a great family book. Had two more children when the first two were in Middle School. They liked it just as much and now I have given it to their children! Our youngest grandchild wouldn't let her father stop reading it to her in the evening and then demanded permission to take the book to bed. She is only 22 months old.
Somewhere along the line in moving around the book was lost. I just bought it for my husband and me. Love it. Thank you Louis Untermeyer for this collection!",2014-05-31,2014

5.0,0002005263,"Oh! this was a super thriller.  But, then I have loved every one of Tony Hillerman's Joe Leaphorn/Jim Chee series. Now that he can no longer write more, I'm reading books by authors Aimee and David Thurlo, to whom Hillerman was their mentor. I enjoy getting a peek into the Native American view of life when it gets entangled with Anglo law, etc.",2014-11-25,2014

4.0,0002005263,"As with all his Chee and Leaphorn novels, Hillerman delivers a clever little mystery sat in the dark southwest that is very worth reading if you like his other books.  There is a conflict between Bernie and Chee over them getting back together after a separation while an enemy lurks in the shadows to cover up a murder for well, you can guess the motive.  I really like his novels since they provide a glimpse into Native American life which I rarely find in other books.  He has a solid and established brand that carries on through generations of readers and novels like this keep the fire burning.  Definitely a wise purchase!",2014-08-22,2014
5.0,0002005263,"I've always enjoyed Tony Hillerman books and this one is no exception.  I love them because the detective mysteries are not predictable, the chance to  learn about the Navajo culture, and the books are safe to read to any of my grandchildren.",2014-08-14,2014

5.0,0002005263,"Tony Hillerman is one of my favorite mystery writers.  I enjoy his two prominent characters, Jim Chee, a young traditional & Joe Leaphorn, the older, but non-traditional Navajo.  Following their adventures as radically different characters is most enjoyable.  Hillerman's descriptions of Arizona's desert country & Navajo culture blend seamlessly into the plots.  Sinister Pig is largely about Bernie Manuelito & her dangerous adventure with the Border Patrol.",2014-08-06,2014

3.0,0002005263,"Once again Leaphorn and Chee engage in a joint effort to solve a crime, and rescue a damsel in distress! This time, Chee finally gets the girl! This tale starts of rather obliquely with the death of an unidentified man seemingly unconnected to the new border patrol job acquired by Officer Bernie Manuelito. The plot unfolds rather rapidly after Bernie's picture shows up in some bad places in Mexico. Actually, the plot unfolds too rapidly and takes away the mystery usually captured in Hillerman tales. However, the reader will enjoy an ending that hints of more adventures to come by a new two-some.",2014-07-28,2014
4.0,0002005263,"I have come to enjoy Tony Hillerman's books.  My friend is a Navajo Indian who grew up on a reservation.  She suggested Tony Hillerman as a good author to learn more about the Navajo culture.  And she was right, I am.  The Sinister Pig is easy reading and educational in more ways than one even realizes as they are reading.  You don't have to pause to wonder what the author means, it is clear as day.  The one thing I wish I had known before purchasing the Sinister Pig is the fact that the many many Hillerman books go in order.  So, I did not have much background information on the characters.  It is possible to still read it, Hillerman does provide some facts from previous books. But, I believe it would have been better if I went in order.  It would have been a much more rounded book with more sympathy or empathy for these characters, provided by reading the previous books. Which I now plan on.",2014-07-26,2014

I lived in Farmington, NM for many years and am familiar with the Navajo Tribe and the many beautiful landscapes and places he describes. His books are always respectful of Navajo culture and a great read!",2014-06-24,2014

5.0,0002005263,"I believe this was Tony Hillerman's last work before his death?  If so, it is a fitting last hurrah to a stellar writing career.  Plot,  characterization, dialogue were all imaginative and superbly written.  It is a story of good (Leaphorn and Chee) and innocence (Bernadette Manuelito) vs super-rich and powerful evil, and a man who redeems himself from evil through his love for a good, although flawed, woman.  Good, innocence, and redemption, after much suspense emerge victorious, of course, and my only disappointment is that the author did not give the villain a more fitting end.  I will miss Hillerman and his characters, his respect for American Indian culture, and the thoroughly Catholic world view that underlies his novels.  Requiescat in Pace.",2014-06-15,2014

My kids (5 and 6 years old) love it, and I love that it has a nice message.

I took it with Prof. Bartlett, who I liked a lot, but I know others thought he was boring. This book is a GREAT book for learning. If you can keep up the reading in this book, then you're bound to get an  A in the class. The class can sometimes go pretty fast and over your head if you don't read, but it is possible to get by with an okay grade without the book.

I also got a free PDF from a friend of the book, but I prefer the physical copy. Overall, I used this book than most of my others, and even in compliment of my BME 201 course material at times. It has FANTASTIC diagrams to teach you Glycolysis, Electron Transport Chain, Photosynthesis, Membrane Transport, etc.

5.0,0001720392,"We love, love, love, this lift-the-flap book. Green Eggs and Ham is a great story. Toddlers love lifting flaps. But this book is even better than that. Many of the flaps are constructed very cleverly so that the flap, when opened, connects with and changes the illustration on the page to further the story. It really is a fun book for both children and adults to read. I highly recommend it for kids ages 18m - 5y.

My only complaint is that the book comes with a sheet of stickers, some of which are meant to be added to the last page. I wish that the last page just had the illustrations and that the stickers were just extra or not included at all. While we placed the stickers in their intended place, some of them have since been torn out so now the flaps are just empty.

Only because I was reading it to my 4 and 6 year old, and an ending like that, open-ended, was a bit of a reach for them. The 4-year old just walked away, didn't seem to care. My 6-year old up until that point had never really experiences a book that doesn't have a traditional ""ending"" so mostly had a lot of questions as to what happens next, how do we know...versus really thinking about the subject matter. She and I did engage in a brief discussion about that, but still it was a bit over her head. It was tough explaining about bombs and destruction, she still isn't aware about what war is, the history of the world, that sort of thing.

Neither child has asked to read it again. So...I don't know, it really isn't a grabbing story, not my fave Dr Seuss book, but because I do think its clever and teaches a very important and deep ideas to kids, I gave it 4 stars. I like that is isn't really dumbed down.",2014-01-20,2014

But in the end I can talk to my kids and say ""did they fix anything with their weapons?""  ""So if you hit Johnny, and then Johnny hits you and you hit Johnny, when does it stop?  Does it fix anything?  What could happen when we fight?""  I believe that this liturature is great for teaching kids to use their words or to simply move on.

It is also perfect for teaching students how to ""pick their battles,"" what I consider to be an underrated skill.  Buttering your bread on one side or the other isn't really a great reason to fight.  The kids laugh and it starts a discussion that involves much critical thinking.",2014-01-11,2014

If you haven't noticed, I read a lot of Hemingway.  The reason for this is that I enjoy (even more) a textbook about him that was written by a Princeton Professor, Carlos Baker.  He understands Hemingway and shares that knowledge in a way that shows the artfulness of the writer.  He diagrams the novels in the same way that my grade school teachers taught me to diagram sentences (noun, verb, adverb and subject, object of the preposition, adjectives and compound sentences, etc.).  Using this textbook I am learning how a writer approaches a novel (as an artist would); hence the title, ""HEMINGWAY, the writer as artist"".  It is one of my favorite books and has been for more than ten years.

For Whom the Bell Tolls (FWBT) was published in 1940, but the notes for it were taken during '37, '38 '39.  It speaks of the loyalist fighting against fascism in Spain.  His detractors called Hemingway a 'Stalinist' or a 'Fascist' at the extremes, but he was neither.  He was simply anti-fascist.  He thought that fascism killed art and literature.  It was just that easy for him to pick a side.
His novel is broad in scope and speaks garishly of the cruel killings by both sides.
He goes into great detail of an incident in which the 'loyalists' torture and kill local fascist shop owners, blowhards, idiots, city officials and priests in a way that is foreign to any experience of my sheltered life. Hemingway shocks the reader by writing the details of killing in a way that reminds us of a bull fight, or the running of the bulls at Pamplona.  This chapter is hard to read.  It is so cruel.  I can only image what it was like with his expletives at full volume.  Artistically it compares with Picasso's 'Guernica' which reminds the world of the insane bombing of that Spanish market town by NAZI fascists. (with loss of life estimated at 1,650)",2014-09-24,2014

They are all bad in different ways, but For Whom the Bell Tolls is particularly bad. This is the one where ""the earth moves""! The one where the Spanish speak a weird and annoying 18th century English. The one where Hemingway's supposedly terse style can go on for dozens of pages of very boring digressions.

The dialogue might seem strange to someone who doesn't know Spanish; all the dialogue is written as if it were directly translated from Spanish, including the formal addresses ""thee"" and ""thou,"" and things like that.  If you know Spanish it won't bother you; if you don't know Spanish, the dialogue (although not the narration) reads a bit like Shakespeare, and maybe even makes this book feel a little more classy than his other writing.

I would give five stars were it not for the way in which Hemmingway translates the intimate pronouns in Spanish (namely the second person ""tu"") into the archaic ""thee"" (and accompanying ""thou"", ""thine"", etc). There is a boatload of this dialog and I felt it detracts from the story, since in this modern age such terms seem archaic. One feels as if he's reading the King James Bible at times.

3.0,0002051850,"For Whom the Bell Tolls features the story of Robert Jordan, an explosives' specialist, during three days in Spain's Civil War.

I will start by saying that it took me ages to finish this book. I'd read The Old Man and The Sea a long time ago and I was curious about Hemingway's masterpiece, but once I started to read it I found it difficult to get into the story. One thing that contributed to that was the writing style. I had heard that it was raw and that the writing was very blunt, but I found it to be beyond that. Sometimes I had the feeling that I was reading a telegram. Specially when it came to the dialogues. Had Hemingway put a stop word at the end of a dialogue sentence and I wouldn't be surprised!

A thing that I found unnecessary was the romance. The only way for me to describe Robert Jordan's and Maria insta love is by calling it Tarzan level. It can me summarized into this: We just met, but I love thee! Thou loves me? Let us get into bed and do things! - end of love story. So I ask: why? Why put romance into this when there's none?

Where I found interest in this story was in Robert Jordan's thoughts and feelings towards his path in life and his faith.

So, in short I didn't dislike it but I can say I liked it as well.

One final note is that this edition is censored and whenever there is a swear word in English it's replaced by the word obscenity (which in some situations ends up being quite funny given the context). All the swear words in Spanish are uncensored.",2014-07-13,2014

I read 'The Old Man and the Sea' many, many years ago ( it was really my inspiration and beginning to what has become a lifelong love of books and reading), and I felt I needed to read more to find out what all the fuss was about. Well, this story may have been gripping in 1935 or 1940 or whenever it was written, but I am struggling to finish it. There is of course the ubiquitous double standard for men and women that was the accepted way of life in its time. I understand all that but its like reading about things that happened on another planet. There's the addressing of each other as 'thee' and 'thou' which I'm guessing has something to do with translating Spanish to English but as the book is in English I have to wonder why this is even addressed. Also, why are all the characters referred to by their first names : 'Pilar', 'Maria', etc., but our hero the protagonist is always identified by both first and last names? It was annoying at first - but I've become used to it at this point I guess. I've suspect that this story is NOT going to have a happy ending but I don't know for sure yet. I don't think Maria is going to get her chance at a lifetime of happiness which would undoubtedly consist of making babies and stew for R.J.",2014-06-29,2014

1.0,0002051850,"I somehow managed to get through high school & college without encountering Hemingway.  I had also never read the Catcher in the Rye, of Mice and Men, etc. so a few years ago I decided that I needed to read some of the ""classics"" that I missed.  I loved to read in high school, mostly Stephen King, Tom Clancy, W.E.B. Griffin, etc.  However, even though I liked reading I found that most of the books I was assigned to read were painful (Wuthering Heights & Ethan Frome stand out as particularly horrible examples!) and I developed an almost visceral reaction to the suggestion that any books were ""classics"".  As an adult I decided it was time to go back and try to cherry pick classis that I might like (sorry, no Tess for me) and try to broaden my knowledge of the ""classics""  My mission was actually going well, & I had found a lot of books that I really liked, and I thought that a good war story by an author as well regarded as Hemingway was a great next choice.

I will not presume to say that I am right & that millions who love this book are wrong, but I really do not understand why this book is considered a classic.  The dialogue is so choppy & forced-formal that it seems like the characters are all talking past each other.  I think it must have something to do with a Spanish translation but it really distracted from the plot.  Bottom line is that I have seldom gotten less involved in a story.  I made it 3/4 of the way through & decided that I did not care if the bridge got blown  up or not and stopped.  I just found the whole thing to be a bloated and a drudging read for what should have been a rather simple (and exciting) story.  I think more than anything else it was the dialogue that put me off, but it will definitely be my last encounter with Hemingway.

5.0,0002051850,"I became hooked on Hemingway long ago when I was in college, and this is the book that got me hooked. In English composition we were being taught how to write interesting sentences, for instance, how many adjectives you could use in describing a person walking down the street. Then I read Hemingway and realized you could write, ""He walked down the street"", because walking wasn't the important thing. The important thing was what was in the heart of the person walking down the street. When Hemingway won the Nobel Prize the committee mentioned THE OLD MAN AND THE SEA, but it would be hard to imagine Hemingway winning the Nobel Prize and becoming one of the three giants of twentieth century American literature without FOR WHOM THE BELL TOLLS. I would recommend this book, but be careful, you just might get hooked on Hemingway.",2014-03-09,2014

5.0,0002051850,"It happened before I finished this book. It was the final epic scene upon the bridge. You'll know the one when you get there. I started to cry. I felt it coming for a few chapters, and then finally it came out and I wept. I'd never done that with a novel before, cried, and I didn't stop myself. It wasn't that the story was the saddest thing I'd ever read or imagined. It's a Hemingway novel, and my favorite author has a way of punching you in the stomach when he's closing out a novel. For examples check out 'A Farewell to Arms' or 'Islands in the Stream'. So I wasn't too surprised to see how this epic magnificent novel was unfolding in its final tragic and violent glory. What suddenly struck me like an icy blade into my heart was the realization that I was reading the truest book that I'd ever read and probably would ever read. The enormity of that was too much to bear. I felt as if I was there, and all the emotions that came in something so highly stressful, dutiful and chaotic came flooding in. Let me say that I'm a veteran of the US Army and I was deployed to the Middle East in 2009, but that I've never shot at another person or killed anyone. But I have, however, been in numerous very high stress situations that flooded my core with anxiety and a sense of duty. Reading 'For Whom the Bell Tolls' rubbed some of those scars raw and I'm thankful for that. I'm not angered that Hemingway's utterly poignant writing showed me things that I'd left behind in the darkest days of my own life. This novel showed me, in the truest way imaginable, that there is such beauty and love to be found in duty and conflict, and it showed me that there's nothing wrong in fighting and standing your ground for something that may not survive the test of time, just as the rebel guerrillas in Spain were ultimately doomed to fail against the Fascists. Robert Jordan will now rank alongside Thomas Hudson and David Bourne as some of the most memorable protagonists of literature that I've ever had the pleasure of reading about.",2014-02-16,2014

Ive been reading it every couple of years since 1997 (In fact, I read it until the pages fell out of my paperback. I have a Kindle edition now). Publishers Weekly says What slows the narrative is the bevy of minor characters, Jo's acquaintances. They talk to her and about her, they try to help her and they conspire against her, all at the expense of the central plotline. I think the minor characters serve to make this a rich story with more depth than you often find. They form the world around the main characters. I fall in love with Tim every time.

Lady of Hay has been recommend to me for quite a while now and I never got a chance to read it. It is a suspenseful novel full of mystery and historical facts about the Welsh culture, specifically the story of Matilda de Braose of the 12th Century, also known as Moll Walbee (1). It is intense, long, enriched with details, tedious at times but you really  get to enjoy the novel. You never get bored. Her life will mainly revolve around three men who so ruled her life: William, the king, and Richard de Clare.(2)

The author used quite a complex medium of narration, I must say, to invite us to the life of Matilda. The main character, Jo submits herself to a series of hypnosis where she is regressed to her previous life. The theme of reincarnation takes full meaning in this novel. Despite my carelessness on these various themes [hypnosis, regression techniques, and reincarnation paraphernalia], I really enjoyed the historical part of this novel. Even if you don't really care, nor is invested into reincarnation, as me,
the splendid work done by the author on the historical part is outstanding. The novel is therefore multilayered and complex.

I definitely will be reading more novels from this author.

[* Spoilers alert!]

My complaints:

5.0,0002005379,"Airborn by Kenneth Oppel is an excellent escape from the mundane, presenting a mystery, adventure, and teen romance all in one.  While the book is written for a teen audience, the plot, characters and writing are complex enough to engage an adult.  The story is set in an ""alternate"" earth where airships, not airplanes, dominate the skies.  Oppel mixes actual earth locations with fictitious ones creating a geography that is familiar, but not identical to ours.  The chronology is set about a century ago, but this is where the book shares characteristics with Hayao Miyazaki's movies:  technology of several different eras are present simultaneously.

The story is set largely aboard the luxury airship Aurora, and is narrated by the cabin boy Matt Cruze.  It begins with a midair rescue which sets the stage for the main adventure a few months later.  Two mysteries presented by the opening are resolved through the rest of the book with one major twist occurring.

The book entertains on multiple levels.  Oppel includes social commentary in character dialog, but keeps focused on the main mystery and plot.  One does not get a detailed description of the world outside the airship, but sees little glimpses of that world from descriptions of the characters and their lives.  The world of the airship is described in much greater depth, but without becoming bogged down in details, and the information given is actually essential to later events.

Over all, ""Airborn"" is fun, giving the reader a pleasant diversion to another place, and for those who like word-play, a nice title!",2014-12-28,2014

5.0,0002005379,"This book has it all, action, adventure, tragedy, and a little bit of romance. The book grabs you from the very beginning and never let's go. It follows the story of boy in his early teens (15 or 16) that is a cabin boy on an airship. While the boy, Matt, is on watch duty he spots a hot air balloon that's been damaged and they proceed to give assistance. There is an old man in the balloon, it's only occupant, and he is badly injured. Before he dies he tells young Matt about a beautiful flying creature that no one has ever seen before. But his ranting and raving are passed of as the words of a confused dieing man. Then a year later Matt meets the old mans granddaughter who's is hell bent on proving her grandfather actually did see a real creature. And thus begins a thrill ride of an adventure that you won't want to put down until you reach the last page.

My thoughts on the book:

I finished this book a little over 2 days while I was on vacation. The characters are very well written, you get a good sense of who they are and become very attached to the few leading characters. The two main characters are Matt Cruse and Kate de Vries. Matt is a level headed young man who thinks everything through and does it quickly and doesn't hesitate to act when he thinks it's needed. He is very adapt on the air ship, and because he has spent so much time on them he know what everything does as well as every inch of them.

Kate on the other hand is a strong willed young woman who doesn't let anything get in the way of her goal, and this gets her into trouble, as well as Matt, throughout the book. Kate is definitely not your average female who is helpless, she is very well studied and reads a lot of books and is very knowledgeable about things Matt has never dreamed of knowing about. That being said she does relay on him for some of the more practical things such as how to find there way back when they go traipsing through the jungle.

All in all I really enjoyed this book it reminded me of some of the Jules Vern books I have read. Very fun and enjoyable read.",2014-06-17,2014

4.0,0001857290,"Diana Wynne Jones has a wonderfully whimsical ability to worldbuild (of which J.K. Rowling should be jealous). Books with magic in are slowly tending to become more technological (as our technology becomes more magical, perhaps, or maybe it's just because of games in which magic has to be ""balanced""); there are clear rules for what can and can't be done. This author was writing before that trend, or ignored it, and her magic is like the magic of folktales. It works because it ought to work, because having it work that way is cool.

She was also writing before ""head-hopping"" (switching between third-person viewpoints in the middle of a scene) became so denigrated, and a couple of times it's disorientating. Her style is the simple, declarative style of books for younger readers, but there's nothing wrong with that, though if I'd been her editor I would have said ""show, don't tell"" a couple of times and suggested more active phrasings for a few sentences. The writing, in other words, isn't flawless, but the story, the characters and especially the world make up for it.

The main viewpoint character is a boy known as Cat, for reasons that, when explained, turn out to be very important. He's afflicted with a sister named Gwendolen, who is as self-centred as a gyroscope and reacts badly to being thwarted, causing a cascade of trouble for poor Cat. By the middle of the book he's in not just one, but four or five bad situations, with no solution in sight, and all of them are Gwendolen's fault.

The secondary characters are delightful. The powerful Chrestomanci, in particular, with his beautiful clothes, is like a less self-centred Howl, but each one of them has some characteristic of appearance or mannerism that makes them distinct and memorable.

This is the first of a series of six books, and I'll be reading the others too, I think.",2014-01-16,2014

The thing to remember here is this isn't your typical fantasy book where the good army fights the evil army, the bad guy gets defeated in the end and so on, this is a book about discovery, a ship searching for seven missing lords and attempting to map unknown waters in the process. It doesn't have the climactic battle ending or anything, but if you're a fan of the Narnia series, it is a necessary tie in between the first books and the final ones, as you now say goodbye to the last of the Pevensies and move ahead to Eustace and Jill Pole (who is probably mentioned once in this book).

The figure if they go through the attics and passageways that connect all the houses, they will end up in the last house, which has been unoccupied for quite some time.  They're not sure what they'll find there, but they expect it will be and adventure.  They don't quite make it as far as the last house, but end up going on an adventure that takes them even further and to many different lands.  They meet a queen, Jadis, who wants to return to their world so she can rule it, after having destroyed her own world.  They come upon a glen with pools that lead to many other worlds and end up traveling to a world of nothingness, so dark that nothing can be seen.  Then something magical happens, they hear a beautiful song and the world around them begins to grow and become.

Great story!  I particularly enjoyed it because I had already read The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe and thus new who Aslan was and that the world being created was Narnia.  I particularly enjoyed how the light post came in to being.

A few good quotes:
""Now the trouble about trying to make yourself stupider than you really are is that you very often succeed.""

4.0,0001844423,"Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy Pevensie are all waiting for the train to return to school when something unexpected happens.  One minute they are on the platform, the next they are in Narnia.  Though they've only been away from Narnia a year in our world, it appears much more time has passed in Narnia.  The children aren't quite sure where they've been whisked away to.  They finally come upon a place to shelter in a ruined building and, though it doesn't look familiar at first, they start to feel rather like they've been there before. The placement of the well and the layout of the rooms finally gets them to thinking this must be Cair Paravel, their old home when they were kings and queens of Narnia.  Though, for this much ruin to have taken place, it has to have been hundreds of years since they were last here.

Prince Caspian is told by his nurse stories of an old Narnia where there are talking beasts and Aslan is the high king.  Miraz, Caspian's uncle, hears of this and quickly gets rid of the nurse and hires a tutor for Caspian.  Miraz does not want anyone discussing the old Narnia; he likes it much better the way it is now with him as the ruler of Narnia.  The new tutor teaches Caspian and helps him escape when it is learned that Caspian is to be killed so he will not take his rightful place as King of Narnia.  Caspian flees his home and soon comes upon an unlikely group of animals; they are talking beasts.  Trufflehunter (a badger) and Trumpkin (a red dwarf) turn out to be Caspian's strongest allies and assist him on his journey to evade Miraz's army.  With the assistance of the talking beasts and the Pevensie's, Caspian must fight to take his rightful place in Narnia.

This installment of the Narnia series brought back more of the wonder that I was longing for and missed in The Horse and His Boy.  I liked meeting the new characters in this book.  Caspian is someone you can root for and I liked Reepicheep, the brave mouse.",2014-08-03,2014
4.0,0001844423,"Lucy and Edmund are staying with relatives and are cooped up with their annoying cousin Eustace.  Eustace doesn't particularly like his cousins and enjoys making fun of them, especially for all their make believe talk of traveling to another world and being kings and queens of a place called Narnia.  Lucy and Edmund dislike Eustace just as much as he dislikes them.  While in one of their typical arguments in the spare bedroom, Lucy notices something odd about the painting with the ship.  It looks as though the waves are moving and the ship is coming straight out of the painting.  Eustace goes to investigate before Lucy and Edmund can warn him about the dangers of magic.  All three are soon found to be small enough to climb onto the edge of the painting.  They all fall into the painting and find themselves in the sea.  They soon find themselves being rescued and brought aboard a boat (the Dawn Treader) by none other than King Caspian.  Caspian fills them in on what has occurred while they were away and tells them of the voyage they have just stumbled upon.  While his uncle Miraz was ruler, he forced many lords to sail away and never return,  as Caspian is now King, he has vowed to voyage and find what has happened to these men.

They set sail on a grand adventure and find many mysterious things along the way.  They sail to the lone islands and discover an island where there is a dragon. One with invisible beings and a magician.  One where dreams become reality.  And past all of these, they journey to the end of the world.

While I don't want to go into all the details of each adventure and spoil the fun of reading this book, I will say that part of the fun was that each island had its own unique perils and adventures.  It was fun jumping from one activity to another.  It was almost as if each island could have been a story unto itself, had details been expounded upon.  I'm glad they weren't though.  There was just enough detail and intrigue with each adventure before moving onto the next.  I think this is one of my favorites in the Narnia series.  My favorite thus far is The Magician's Nephew, followed by this one and The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe.  With two left in the series, it will be interesting to see if my opinion changes.",2014-08-03,2014
3.0,0001844423,"While wandering around the woods, Shift and Puzzle come across a lion pelt.  Shift had a wonderful idea to fashion the pelt into something that Puzzle could wear and pretend to be Aslan.  Soon, word gets to King Tirian that strange things are happening.  The woods are being chopped down and decimated, killing nymphs, only to be sold for money to the Calormen.  Horses, talking horses, are being whipped into service to transport the wood.  All this seems to fly in the face of Aslan, but it is in his name that the horrifying work is said to be done.  While trying to set things right, King Tirian is captured and left chained to a tree to waste away.  It is then that he is transported, as if in a dream, to a place where he sees seven kings and queens of Narnia.  He comes to and realizes he hasn't gone anywhere.  Before he can despair, he sees a girl and boy have come to help rescue him. Eustace Scrubb and Jill Pole have returned to Narnia to assist the King.

***spoiler alert***
This story definitely felt different than the rest.  There was a lot of story in Narnia before Eustace and Jill travelled there to help out, where usually the story jumps right in with the kids traveling from our world to Narnia.  The majority of the story was about a false Aslan used to get one's own way.  It was also a bit on the nose about gods, false gods, and heaven for me.  Not really my cup of tea.  That said, I actually did enjoy the ending of Narnia.  Though  it was a bit sad, it felt like the story came full circle with Polly and Diggory witnessing the beginning of a new world to Eustace and Jill and the others witnessing the collapse of a dying world.",2014-08-03,2014

The ape gets annoying as a bully to poor Puzzle the donkey, and I find it sad that Susan no longer believes in Narnia. However, that is a sad reality in the lives of many people.

5.0,0001844423,"This book is often downplayed as the least ""exciting"" of the Chronicles, but after re-reading it recently I found I enjoyed it more than I recalled.  It details the Pevensie children's return to Narnia as well as Caspian's youth, escape from his usurping uncle King Miraz, and the uprising of ""Old Narnia"" who champion him as their true king.  Themes include faithfulness, belief under persecution, doing the right thing even when others don't support you, and bravery in the face of probable defeat. In Narnia, of course, many elements of our Greek/Roman mythology are actively present - at least when Aslan calls them forth.  Many of us have probably wondered what it would be like to see places we are fond of and/or have lived in once they become part of the past, or archaeological sites, and Lewis does a nice job of that with Cair Paravel (although we note that it is restored and in use by the time of Voyage of the Dawn Treader).

Christians will see profoundly meaningful themes in these books; this series gives the essence of the Bible storyline from beginning to end, to children, without once mentioning Jesus or any of the Bible characters. Lewis takes decades of pondering difficult themes such as good and evil, death, choices, etc., and presents them to children in a simple and profound way.

She will love it as much as I do, I predict. The layers of the city are peeled back through Dalrymple's sensitive approach to history and culture, and the reader is transported to places and times that are long gone, as well as those that are contemporary. Walking through the streets of New Delhi and Old, the reader feels as though the City has come alive in some other dimension.

This is an deep dive into some hidden aspects of an ancient and fascinating city.  Much of which is barely visible in this very modern city, but is still important - essential even - to understanding Delhi.

I was lucky enough to read this book while living in Delhi for a year myself.  Certain aspects of the city the book covers, like the eunuchs, and part-British Indians are largely faded from the landscape.. many only there if you look hard enough like Dalrymple does.  Even if you don't experience them directly, they give context to certain areas of the city... places you might pass over without a second glance take on a whole different perspective.

If nothing else stood out from the books, the writers take on the riots after Indira Gandhi's death are worth the read.  The subtle undercurrents of tension in India can often be lost on the casual observer.  But if you want to understand this complex city, it's worth learning the harshest parts.  Often history glosses over the dark parts, but this book dives right in.  After all, the Djinn's are the ghosts that make the city what it is.

This is a fictional novel based on the Nanking massacre and it goes back and forth between the experiences of a Chinese man caught in Nanking at the time (1937) and a British girl in modern-day Japan looking for a kind of snuff film from 1937.

I felt the author could've said enough in half the pages, without going into the narrator's back story (which seemed full of gratuitous sexual detail) or the guy she ends up meeting in Japan. Considering the horrible stuff going on already in the flashbacks in Nanking, I don't see why Hayden had to cram more of the same in the present-day narration.

She is considered 'crazy' by most people, and has been institutionalized at one point when she was younger. Why is not clear until the end of the book.  While a student at Cambridge she does research on the arcane subject of the Japanese desecration of the Chinese city of Nanking in 1937. She goes to Japan to try to find a Chinese scholar who lived through the period and supposedly has an old film that shows exactly what the Japanese did in Nanking.  To support herself she works in a high end club in Tokyo and runs into a very old Japanese Mafioso who has apparently found the secret to living forever. The Chinese scholar wants the secret 'elixir', as he thinks, and he will only give the girl the film if she finds and gives him the elixir. There is an American love interest, also, who ends up providing the pivotal turn in the plot line.  At that point the girl, her boyfriend, the Chinese scholar, the Mafioso, and the 'elixir' all come together and the plot gets really strange, gruesome, but un-put-down-able.  The narrative gets absolutely horrific at times, and there were points when I could only read twenty pages or so at a time, but I had to keep reading till the end, and was rewarded with all the plot lines coming together in the end, and my 'why' questions being answered.  I don't think 'enjoyed' is the right word for how I felt when I finished this book, but I've never read anything else so fascinating in my life!

Nanking is a place where cultures and questionable revisionism collide, mixed with a sinister blend of erotic secrets and international intrigue. Throw in a big, moldering house with unexplored rooms and a lush, walled garden of tangled foliage for good measure. We are kept on edge throughout the narrative, wondering when we will fall into the darkness.

However we wished to assimilate and normalize our guilt over the dropping of nuclear weapons on Japan, ignoring the behavior of Japanese troops in Nan King (and later THEIR governments' removal of the matter from their history books) can never be the answer.  We must look clearly at the past, or we will repeat it again and again.
As a novel this is, I believe, one of Mo Hayder's best.  Weaving in and out of history it brings you close to the horrors of the Yakuda, and the power that these gangsters have over everyday life in Japan.  And it interweaves one person's great loss with anothers.",2014-04-20,2014

I often wonder, ""How many hours did he labor to get exactly the right combination of nouns, adjectives, verbs, and adverbs to make this master construction of a sentence?""  The Blue Bear is non-fiction at its best.  It tells of the friendship between the author and a Japanese nature photographer, Michio Hoshino.  Hoshino wants to get a picture of a rare glacier bear or blue bear.  Schooler and Hoshino spent more than a decade looking for such a bear and their friendship grew and flourished during that time.

This book is a massive compilation of animal studies reported in a friendly style. Ardrey makes it clear that all is not warm and fuzzy in the animal world. He is not advocating aggression, of course. He is honoring the restraint of aggression necessary for mammals to live together.

The mammal brain manages social interactions by releasing neurochemicals. Ardrey figured this out long before modern neuroscience. He invented a term that powerfully captures the behavior: ""the amity-enmity complex."" Mammals typically live in small groups where each individual knows the strength of each other, he explains. A mammal cedes food and mating opportunity to stronger individuals to avoid getting bitten. As unpleasant as this is, mammals stick with the group because they die in the jaws of a predator if they leave. (In the case of lions, their meals end up in the jaws of hyenas and they starve to death.) Common enemies are the social glue that bonds mammal groups despite internal tensions. It's easy to see this everywhere except in yourself, because your cortex rationalizes the neurochemical impulses of your limbic system.

Today, animal impulses are widely misrepresented by academics and journalists. They want us to believe that animals live in collectivist harmony. For example, when a chimpanzee succeeds at catching meat, he tends to give it to the group leader. This is widely reported as evidence that he shuns self-interest and focuses on the greater good. In truth, the hunter is protecting himself from a painful mauling by the alpha chimp, who seizes resources and shares them with his allies. The alpha's hold on power and fertile females is thus enhanced in the manner known to every dictator and Mafia chief. Academics and journalists call it ""cooperation"" when animals and partisans do it, though they of course hate it when the rewards to self-interest accrue to those they perceive as the other team.

Ardrey introduces the brilliant term ""nice-kitty fallacy"" for what is often called the romantic or Rousseau fallacy. However well-intentioned, this fallacy does more harm than good. It excuses violence and extortion when your allies do it, even as you condemn the other guys' self-interest as an intolerable outrage. I do not agree with every word in this book. But I think people must learn about their mammalian impulses so they can get beyond the habit of bonding around common enemies. That is why I dedicated my last book to Robert Ardrey (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Beyond-Cynical-Transcend-Your-Mammalian-Negativity/dp/1941959024/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Beyond Cynical: Transcend Your Mammalian Negativity</a>)",2014-08-26,2014

5.0,0002155192,"AMAZON review:
 I bought eight new copies of this universally-beloved little book.  I'm a Unitarian Universalist and picked up a dog-eared copy of it for 25 cents at my church's last book sale. That's the one I'll keep and I'll give a new one back to our book sales, and add another to our church library.  That will leave six for Christmas presents.
 Perhaps Mister God, This Is Anna has been circulating at our book sales for years, passed on from one to another.  If so, it's because Anna's feisty, deeply questioning, spontaneous, chatty, forgiving, widely embracing, crazy about science & math, outrageously heretical, and definitely self-generated religion appeals to UUs, even if most of us don't have Anna's continual conversations with God (and some doubt his/her/its existence).  Personally I'm a student of Process Theology, or Panentheism, so I tend to agree with a great many of this little genius tomboy girl's ideas. The most popular UU adult education curriculum, ever, is called ""Building Your Own Theology""--and that's what Anna does, building her own theology throughout this inspiring and glorious book!  It's listed as nonfiction, but I don't know how much of it contains the real ideas of a small child awash in innocence and love, how much are novelistic devices and speculations of the author, Fynn--a pen name.  Did someone named Anna really live in a slummy section of London and die at age 8 just before Britain entered World War II?  Or did Fynn end it there, knowing how difficult it would be to juggle the narrative with the drafting of young men his age and the exile of children to far away villages during the Luftwaffe bombing?  Who is, or was, Fynn?  If he's still alive he'd be very old.  It doesn't really matter.  Anna's personality and ideas are what touch the reader.  I love this book, and Fynn, and Fynn's mother, and the shopkeepers, and Anna's prostitute friends, and her boredom in the parish church that preaches what she considers crazy ideas about God.  I especially love Anna.  She creates love, leaves it in her footsteps.

4.0,0001054783,"Very late period Holmes stories. Like many readers, I feel there is a steep decline in quality and originality in the later Conan Doyle stories. But even with clunkers like ""The Three Garridebs,"" ""The Mazarin Stone,"" and ""The Veiled Lodger,"" you have the two undeniable classics of ""The Illustrious Client"" and ""The Problem of Thor Bridge"". You also have the stylistic departure of ""The Lion's Mane,"" one of only three stories in the canon not narrated by Watson. So while I would urge anyone new to the original stories always to begin with ""The Adventures,"" ""The Memoirs,"" and ""The Return,"" both ""The Casebook"" and ""His Last Bow"" have much to recommend them.",2014-09-11,2014
4.0,0001054783,I enjoyed these short stories.  They are not as detailed or complex as many of the other stories about Holmes but still a fun read.  The Casebook is a great way to round off and complete the Holmes saga.,2014-08-21,2014
