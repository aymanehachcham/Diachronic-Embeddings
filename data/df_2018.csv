2.0,0002051850,"I am obviously not a Hemingway fan. I did not get the character development that would keep me engaged and the stilted dialog did not do for me what I believe the author intended. The time period is the Spanish Civil War and I believe Hemingway was trying to let the reader know the dialog was in Spanish and we were ""reading the subtitles"" or something of the sort. There was considerable repetition of non-essentials that I found terribly boring. This was a book I was reading for my book club and left for vacation before I could check it out at my local library so I borrowed one from the library in the town where we stayed and then ordered this when I got home.

5.0,0001945424,"This book is a classic beauty. Id read it years ago as a youngster and decided to buy it for myself after telling my sister all about the characters. Now, I find it even more beautiful than I was able to appreciate then.
A Little Princess is about the power of imagination, friendship, hope. Believing in yourself and who you are, looking at the person inside and ignoring external trappings. Considering it was written during imperialism and at a time when social classes were still quite rigid, especially in England where the story is based, its impressive that this book manages to exude such humanism while portraying the authenticity of the society and the times.
Readers will fall in love with Sara, Becky, Ram Dass, the Large Family, and all the other folks (human and animal companions!) as they learn lessons about people and themselves. Its an entertaining, empowering, and inspiring read for all ages.",2018-03-03,2018

4.0,0001945424,"Despite being a voracious reader, there are some books considered ""children's classics"" that I have never read.  I decided to rectify this recently by picking up ""The Secret Garden.""  I was somewhat familiar with the story, as I'd watched a film adaptation of the story at one point, but am fully aware that books and their movies can often be vastly different.  So though I could predict certain things about the story as I read, I still found it an enjoyable read... even if it isn't my favorite book, and certain elements felt strange in their inclusion, especially towards the end.

""The Secret Garden"" follows Mary, a spoiled and unlikable young girl and the daughter of a British officer living in India.  When her parents die of a terrible sickness, she's shuttled off to England to live with a reclusive uncle, and finds herself lost and alone in the gloomy manor.  But as she sets out to explore her new home and make sense of this strange new land, she discovers the titular secret garden -- a garden that has been locked up since her aunt died in a tragic accident ten years ago.  Enchanted by the garden, Mary sets out to tend it and bring it back to life, aided by a grouchy gardener, a soft-hearted animal-loving boy named Dickon... and Colin, a cousin who has been locked inside all his life and treated like an invalid.  The garden turns out to be just the thing both Mary and Colin need to revitalize themselves... and it just may finally bring healing to a family long broken by tragedy...

""The Secret Garden"" is an enchanting novel, told with an almost fairy-tale-like language that evokes the sights, sounds, and smells of the English moors and gardens and their inhabitants.  The writing style is lovely, and paints clear pictures in the mind.  The heavy Yorkshire accents of certain characters can be tricky at times, but I managed anyhow.  And while Dickon as a character feels a little too good to be true, almost straying into Mary-Sue territory, it's nice to see Mary and Colin develop as the book goes in, gaining confidence in themselves and shedding some of the selfishness and bad temper their sheltered lives have given them.

The biggest flaw, in my opinion, is that the book strays into a weird fantasy/magical-realism realm toward the end, which I feel wasn't foreshadowed very well.  I love fantasy and don't mind magical realism, but it felt out of place here, especially with Colin going on about studying ""magic"" while at the same time declaring he wants to be a scientist.  It just felt odd to me, and while it might be a product of its time (this book IS over a century old), it did taint my enjoyment somewhat.

Still, complaints aside, I can easily see why ""The Secret Garden"" enjoys a reputation as a children's classic.  It's not the best children's novel I've ever read, but I enjoyed it, and am glad I gave it a chance.  Perhaps I'll pick up the author's other classic, ""A Little Princess,"" sometime in the near future...",2018-01-20,2018

5.0,0001945424,"One hundred years (plus) later and this book holds up extremely well. I have never read it before and I'm so glad I put it on my list to read this year.

I love gardening and the joy and magic that is discussed about being outdoors and communing with nature resonated with me.

It is a simple adventure but holds a greater and wider meaning on how to live a happy life. I would definitely recommend reading, especially in spring when one can watch the Earth bloom along side the secret garden.",2018-01-08,2018
