And you've got your 1 star reviewers up in arms because the kid gets to stay in bed. OH NO! (Screams the logical person) a kid gets to sleep in? How terrible.
I read a review by a ""working parent"" (congratulations on being a part of the group known as everybody) who was so upset that it seems this book will derail her whole life. I think a little good parenting would prevent that. Plus, as a working parent it's kinda nice when the kids want to sleep in. It gives you a little down time. Was it the best Seuss book?

5.0,0001720392,"A SUESSIAN CLASSIC !!!

Oh how I like to review books.
I discuss them after taking looks.
I discuss them before hanging hooks.
I discuss them while hiding in nooks!

What can I say? Dr Suess just brings out the playful joyous side in me. And isn't that the whole point? Dr Suess makes books that are fun to read to kids and that kids can easily start to read themselves! Dr Suess made me love reading as a child and now 30 years later Dr Suess's magic works on my daughter as she won't put these books down.

And since my daughter is a picky eater, Green Eggs and Ham has a particularly relevant message (TRY food before declaring you hate it) that actually worked once to convince my daughter to try something new.

All in all Green Eggs and Ham is a must have for your Dr Suess library. It's one of his all time best!

3.0,0002051850,"I will admit first that I am not an Ernest Hemingway fan. I think he's an overrated author.  I find his writing boring and too elementary.

With that said, this book was fairly entertaining.  There was a lot more to it than ""The Sun Also Rises"" for example.  This book actually has a plot, and an interesting one at that.  Hemingway spends a lot of time focusing on the love relationship that develops between the main protagonist and a young woman.  Unfortunately it is quite boring because I feel the woman is not a well developed character.

In my opinion, it's essentially a good short story that he stretched out with a lot of filler to be a novel.",2015-12-08,2015

5.0,0002051850,"There are war stories and there are war stories.  Hemingway's reputation is solidified by this one, principally because of its alternating internal monologs, character constructions, and its fastidiousness of understanding of the Spanish Civil War.  You learn a lot along the way. In Homage to Catalonia, Orwell wrote ""first of all the physical memories: the sounds, the smells, the surfaces of things""  Hemingway has all of those in spades.

The sentence structure jumps a lot making it stifr (subj-verb, subj-verb). The narrations switch mid-sentence from third person to first person regularly. This may be to get the info to the reader and then jump in the head of the character, but it's confusing. The repetition is over the top. Again, it often shows the obsession of thought of a character, but it makes me want to jump to the next paragraph. Don't think I missed anything when I did that. I like some other of Mr Hemingway's literary contributions, and I do recall watching this movie when much younger, but ugh...Only finished because it was a looong plane ride and I thought I should to understand what others see.

4.0,0002051850,"For Whom the Bell Tolls is a highly acclaimed war novel by master writer Ernest Hemingway. It was published in 1940 and tells the story of Robert Jordan, a young American in the International Brigades attached to a republican guerrilla unit during the Spanish Civil War. As a dynamiter, he is assigned to blow up a bridge during an attack. Hemingway describes the life of leftist guerrilla fighters in a series of skirmishes and camp fire vignettes; plunging the reader into a world of pine tree forests and counter intelligence. The characters of the morally repugnant and swine-eyed Pablo, as well as the strong willed Pilar, are indeed memorable. What sets this novel apart from othersis Hemingways own economical and inimitable style. Hemingway wrote without ornamentation  a symptom of his having been a journalist  and could evoke great emotion with his select choice of words. The recount of Sordos last stand, for example, is a particularly harrowing part in the book. Hemingways larger than life reputation preceded him when he was alive. He won the Nobel Prize for literature; as well as a Pulitzer prize for his Novella The Old Man and the Sea. Hemingways fiction seemed to fuel the legend that surrounded him as an author. He had served as an ambulance driver in WW1and much later travelled to Spain as a journalist to cover the civil war there; and no doubt his first-hand experiences inspired and helped to colour his writing. The book has various themes at its heart such as idealism and the fight against fascism (ie. fighting the good fight)as well as death in war, the transitory nature of life etc. The title of the book, For whom the bell tolls, comes from a line in a John Donne poem and is in reference to the symbolic funeral bell and the kinship all men share because of their mortality - No man is an island, entire of itselfFor whom the bell tolls, It tolls for thee.",2015-09-04,2015
5.0,0002051850,"Just a quick note: I recently reread this when I was reminded of the complexities of the Spanish Civil War by a magazine article.  The book did what I dimly remembered it did: it showed the local, human dimension of the war rather than the history book battle of ideologies we usually see.  What I hadnt remmbered was the subtlety and complexity  of the love story. Ive always thought Hemingways ability to present love has been underrated by many people who prefer to focus on the unwillingness of many of his characters to talk about their feelings.  Its true, his characters generally don't have much to say on the subject, and even their inner monologues tend to be sparse, but Hemingway still manages to express his characters deep, vital and nuanced feelings. I think the lack of verbiage is part a reflection of the view expressed by many of his characters that it doesnt do to talk about significant things too much and part the simple fact that the characters themselves don't understand what they're feeling.
Hemingway was a fabulous writer, and much of his work, though clearly rooted in his time period, still stands up to scrutiny today.",2015-09-02,2015

4.0,0002051850,"After finishing this book I feel like I want to read it again in order to fully appreciate it.  The book's dialogue is written in English but is describing conversations that are occurring in Spanish.  So Hemingway writes in formal old English and following the syntax of the Spanish language.  This makes it a more authentic experience but somewhat more difficult to read.
Most of the story concerns the thoughts of the main characters as they prepare themselves to die in battle very soon.  So be prepared for a depressing set of thoughts and expressions.",2015-08-21,2015
5.0,0002051850,"For Whom the Bell Tolls is not the first Hemingway I've ever read.  That would be Hills Like White Elephants, which, like most US college students, I had to study in my short stories class.  Now, roughly 13 years later, I've been attempting to go back and read all the classics that my high school and university professors tried to get us to read.

For Whom the Bell Tolls is a gripping read.  Once you make it about a third of the way you will be hooked until the end.

As this is considered a classic, I read it with a slow, active reader's eye, paying as much attention to the prose and word choice as anything else.  The dialog is superb, even in spite of Hemingway's controversial choice of having the characters speak in an Old English style.  Reading it quickly becomes second nature.  Never have I seen so much character imbued in dialog.

Hemingway also doesn't overload the reader with details of setting.  He gives you just enough detail that you can project your own mental image and get on with the plot.

The action is well described.  Hemingway himself was involved in fighting in several wars, and his familiarity with combat really shows through in the battle scenes.

The prose isn't perfect.  Though Hemingway exercises his typical avoidance for large, ornate words, descriptions and dialog can be nonetheless wordy and flowery.  Pilar's description of the smell of death dragged on for pages, and was useless besides since her palm reading served the same plot purpose.  There are other passages in the book where I felt like Hemingway indulged a bit too much in wordiness.

That leads to the book being a touch too long.  If the wordiness had been wrangled in a bit and certain subplots excised, I think the book would have been a much tighter experience.

Still, I think it's an excellent book.  It's definitely one that you will remember.",2015-08-20,2015

5.0,0002051850,"I read this on the heals of Amanda Vaill's very good book ""Hotel Florida"" (Farrar, Strauss 2014) describing the Spanish Civil War of 1936-39 through the experiencing of it by Hemingway and others as correspondents and photographers.  Hemingway wrote this in 1940 with resounding success.

A young American professor who teaches Spanish at a university in Montana signs on as a partisan volunteer.  It's because he's anti-fascist more so than being pro-Communist.  This is Robert Jordan a demolitions expert, a skill he learned after arriving in Spain.  He's known now as a dynamiter.
He becomes part of a small group, 8 or 9 insurgents, hiding out in the mountains near Segovia making their home in a cave.  They are a motley group, which is part of the charm of the novel.  The dialogue between them and Jordan is a major part of the story.  Who can be trusted?  Who has the nerve to carry out their responsibiltiy?  Can this person be depended on or should he be knifed or shot?  It's rich with characterization.

Marie has been brought into the group.  Young, charming, and having been sexually abused and hair growing out after having been cut off as part of the cruelty inflicted on her.  She and Roberto are a match from the start.  They pledge their enduring love.

Roberto's assignment is to blow up a bridge in the hinterland.  This  is easy enough.  Two guards are on duty at all times and 5-6 others are billeted close by to take their turns.  They can be eliminated.  The problem is that the bridge must be blown at just the right time; as soon as Roberto hears the bombardment that signals the Spanish attack.  The purpose is to cut off the resupply of the rebel (Franco's) forces which must cross over the bridge to get to the battleground.  Blow it too soon and the rebels will be alerted and throw pontoons across; the element of surprise is lost.  Too late, and the rebels will be crossing the bridge and it will be impossible to take out the bridge.  To compound Robert Jordan's problems  a traitor in his group has stolen all the dynamite caps.  Not only must the dynamite be fastened in place under the bridge at the key places in the structure, but it must be detonated by hand grenades with the triggers pulled by long thin strings to places of shelter on the shore.  And the guards have to be eliminated before any of this.

Hemingway is at his best in building suspense.  Can they kill the guards?  Can Jordan attach the dynamite and the grenades?  Will it work?  Can he get it done before the bombardment signals that the bridge must be blown?  Can they escape?  Is Marie safe (she's guarding their horses)?

Don't expect this book to make you a historian of the War, but it will acquaint you with backwoods guerrilla war, the atrocities, the idiocies, the evil that corrupts a soldier's soul.",2015-06-27,2015

Powerfully written, it is in every way a classic well worth reading.",2015-05-29,2015
5.0,0002051850,"The writing is gorgeous and not at all what I was expecting. I have previously read some of Hemingways short stories which had his famous sparse style. The writing in this novel, however, while clear and crisp, has a rhythm and generous beauty that makes the reading almost sumptuous. My only warning for would-be buyers of this book: be patient to get the most from the novel.

The story is set during the Spanish civil war in the 1930s. Robert Jordan, an American professor of Spanish, has come over to help the Republic fight the Fascists as a demolition man. He is sent to blow up a bridge at a specific day and time, creating a countdown where, as a result of the diminishing hours, he spends four intense days with a small guerrilla force, creating tight, intimate relationships.

Ill be honest. The first half of the book put me to sleep; but Im not saying this as a criticism, I swear! The language was so mesmerizing, repetitive, and rhythmic, that it created a hypnotic effect that kept making me drowsy. I had to be so patient. I couldn't read with any distractions and often read only a dozen or so pages at a time to help with my focus.

The second half of the book, in stark contrast, accentuates the countdown to blowing up the bridge. The plot started to fly by, and I found myself going faster through the writing than I wanted to. I had to really focus on keeping my reading at a steady pace to catch all of the narrative and not skip anything. Again, I found I needed all my patience and focus, but in an entirely different way.

There are no bad parts to this book. The characters, language, pacing, plot, everything is well done. Chapters often set aside the plot for a while as characters give us their personal anecdotal histories or conversations, but these asides add so much depth to the narrative that they seem integral to the whole story.

Heres my example of his writing style on pg. 323, Chapter 27: Dying was nothing and he had no picture of it. But living was a field of grain blowing in the wind on the side of a hill. Living was a hawk in the sky. Living was an earthen jar of water in the dust of the threshing with the grain flailed out and the chaff blowing. Living was a horse between your legs and a carbine under one leg and a hill and a valley and a stream with trees along it and the far side of the valley and the hills beyond. Theres nothing about the style here thats sparse. Repetitive and clear, but so lovely as the time that I find it captivating.

I was in a book club that read this, and I can tell you the only downside to this book is that we all agreed so well upon it, the conversation lacked any good argument or intensity (although we did understood the novel much better afterwards). I encourage book groups to read this book as there is so much depth here to explore; I easily created pages of discussion questions and could create so many more if I spent more time with the book. This would also make an excellent book for anyone interested in reading classics. Someday Im going to read this book again, and I know that Ill get even more out of it then.",2015-05-27,2015

It is told from the viewpoint of a programmer (it's basically his diary) so that gave the author a little leeway in terms of style and vocabulary, which I sort of viewed as a cop out at first. The character is very likeable though, so the problems I had with the style actually became endearing as I flipped the pages. The ending is sort of anti-climactic, but I do respect the lack of blatant drama which is prevalent in generic fiction.

I highly enjoyed his well thought out focused argument about where we are heading using evolution and creation together. It tied science and faith up in a nice little bow, rather than pitting one against the other.
Some may have difficulty with the language, since it is ""man"" type language, but recognize that it was written before a time when one would write ""humankind."" I write that because I posted some quotes on my social media sites and some criticized that I used ""mankind"" rather than being inclusive. I understand the need, but don't let the language be a stumbling block for a well thought out analysis of where we are heading.
One should also recognize that some of the science is a bit dated with some being out of date. Some of the evolutionary studies have changed since the writing of the book, so it has a few strikes against the conclusions.",2015-02-20,2015

4.0,0002005379,"The Airship Aurora isn't the only thing here that's lighter than air, but that's O.K.

This feels like a middle grade, early YA adventure. With the airship and the alternate technology it is steampunk, but that aspect isn't heavily featured and the tech frames and informs the story but doesn't dominate it. In a similar vein, there's swashbuckling adventure that makes this a direct descendant of high seas pirate adventures, but again that's mostly for flavor and atmosphere.

Our two primary characters, mild and modest but daring and stalwart Matt, and sassy, spirited Kate, carry the burden of the story effortlessly. Matt is an engaging narrator. Kate is a worthy and equal companion in adventure. Neither is loaded with quirks and while they aren't developed deeply they are fleshed out as completely as necessary for this type of adventure.

This is a modest, well crafted, imaginative, good-hearted, good-humored adventure. It's crisp, clear, fast paced and briskly plotted. It doesn't always go for big effects, and its appeal to me was built up from a number of small observations, events, descriptions, bits of dialogue and characters. That's what made it seem especially appealing for newer and younger readers testing the water for this type of fiction. As such, it struck me as a fine and entertaining introduction to the genre.",2015-09-14,2015

5.0,0002005379,Wonderful storyline and very entertaining. The novel moves at a good pace and leads to a creditable conclusions. I am ordering the 2nd one in this series.,2015-05-23,2015
4.0,0002005379,"The good: apart from a couple of homonym errors (breech/breach, broach/brooch) and a few minor typos, this is well-edited and reads smoothly. It's exciting and full of varied adventures.

The bad: the plot relies heavily on coincidence, culminating in a deus ex machina. Also challenging the suspension of disbelief are some conspicuous science fails.

OK, I was willing to bracket the gas that's lighter than hydrogen, completely inert, and smells of mangoes, and set it aside in the name of enjoying the story, even though that makes no sense in chemistry, physics or biology. But there's no way that you could trap enough of it in a pair of (untreated) silk harem pants to lift two teenagers, who have to weigh at least 200 pounds between them, probably more. This would be true even if they weren't rising through <i>more of the same gas</i>, which reveals that the author has no clue about physics whatsoever.

The coincidences, though, are much harder on the suspension of disbelief.

<spoiler>The main character happens to rescue a man who's passing in a balloon. The man's granddaughter happens to be a passenger on the same ship a year later. (OK, maybe she deliberately went on the ship that rescued her grandfather, though I don't recall that being mentioned). The ship happens to be attacked by pirates, who happen to cause it to crash, though it happens to make it to an uncharted island a thousand miles from anywhere else, where the grandfather had seen strange creatures and written about them in his journal. This happens to be the pirates' base, and by this point I am over-coincidenced. But wait! here's more! The strange creatures turn up again, just in time to rescue Our Hero from the pirate leader, almost like some kind of god being let down out of a machine.</spoiler>

It's a tribute to the storytelling that I still enjoyed this, despite these serious issues. I don't think I will read the sequel, though.",2015-05-17,2015

When the children are orphaned, they are taken in by the mysterious figure of Chrestomanci, and taken to live in his strange castle, where odd dangers seem to lurk around every corner, and Cat finds it increasingly more difficult to understand what's happening, especially when his sister disappears and is replaced by an exact duplicate!

The version I received has a different cover and the medallion on front says it's for the 100th anniversary, no the 50th, as pictured. Perhaps after I return this I'll be able to locate the 50th anniversary edition, where I hope they hadn't yet figured out how to mess with a perfectly good thing. Seriously, this whole re-ordering business was a plot by the White Witch. Aside from this one fatal flaw, the book itself is masterfully done. Full color pictures - the ones done by the original illustrator, and an elegant two-column layout for the text, with a ribbon for bookmarking.

4.0,0001844423,This was a great alternative to buying other sets.  We like that it is one big book rather than a bunch in a box set.  Having be placed in C.S.Lewis' preferred order is neat too.

5.0,0001844423,"Everyone should love Narnia. I was supposed to read this as a school project. Needless to say, that wasn't exactly a chore for me!

I have read the lion, the witch, and the wardrobe before and this really does explain every part of that, from how the white witch started to how there was another world to who the professor was other than just ""professor"" and even how the wardrobe got there and became a portal practically.

Not to mention the warning here from Aslan made sense, with the whole world war 2 setting the lion, the witch, and the wardrobe has.

I feel like this should be a big formal review for a book like this, but I can't do that.
But I do know if you're 8 or younger, you won't really get Narnia, so you might as well leave it alone. I had to read Narnia when I was about 8. And not only was I bored, but I had no idea what was going on.

But reading Narnia now, a few years later, and I can't put it down.

So it's great unless you're a smallish child.",2015-09-02,2015

5.0,0001844423,"We listened to the series over an extended road trip this summer - several hundred miles with no screen time and no whining! There are a few instances when the background music seems to overpower some of the audio, but not to the point of being problematic. The audio dramas are wonderfully done and really bring the stories to life, but that means these are slightly abridged. However, instead of detracting from the author's message the dramas inspired us to read the books as a family to find any details we might have missed. Highly recommend, with no reservations!",2015-09-01,2015
5.0,0001844423,"Although there might be a ""4"" on the cover of this one, it's definitely best read as the second book in the series (after The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe). Without spoiling anything for anyone who is unfamiliar with the story, this does a wonderful job as a return to the fantastic world of Narnia first discovered in The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe. By re-introducing us with characters we already knew but adding some very memorable new ones, the world and the possibilities of Narnia expand, and some beginnings and endings take place.

As far as the Kindle version of this book, it reads very cleanly with color illustrations if you're reading on a color device and does a great job recreating what it was like reading from a box set many years ago.",2015-08-30,2015

My favorite are The Magician's Nephew (origin of Narnia and comes first in the timeline, though written after the first book); The Lion, the Witch, and The Wardrobe; A Horse and His Boy; and The Last Battle (the seventh and final book).

The last page of the last book is the best description of what heaven will be like outside the Bible.

I still own that copy all these years later and have continued the tradition with my kids. These books are as complex as you want them to be. They're great for children because Lewis writes in a free-flowing style with some subtle humor. To children, the books are about adventures and fantastical worlds beyond our own. Adults might appreciate the underlying allegory better and thus enjoy the books in this way as well.",2015-07-29,2015

I'm an adult, and I appreciate esoteric/myth ... I think it's interesting that a fast-paced (somewhat-)modern children's (fairy-tale) anthology alludes to Christ & his story /saga.

Digory and Polly were far from being insipid and intolerable children as I tend to expect.  I quite liked them, especially Polly insisting that Digory apologize for hurting her, his recognizing he had done wrong, and her graceful acceptance of his apology.

Jadis seemed a bit derivative, if C S Lewis had actually read any H P Lovecraft.  Or maybe she just reminded me of Joss Whedon's Illyria.  She was scary, no question.

This had some elements of deus ex machina such as the apple only working on Jadis in a certain way, and working a different way back in our world, but it's a children's fantasy so I'm not complaining much.",2015-02-17,2015

A computer programmer is out of work and keeping house while his wife, an up and coming computer specialist, works. When she starts behaving strangely, he suspects she's having an affair. Worse, he fears she's beginning to document things he says and does in preparation for an 'alienation of affection' suit that will take his children away from him during a divorce.

Then he's offered a contract job for the company she works for. It seems her company bought his program from the company that fired him. They are experiencing problems with it and want him to fix it.

He's afraid he'll be the fall guy -- again -- if the kinks can't be worked out and is hesitant. Then his wife has an accident and things go screwy. It seems the only way he can find out what's going on is to take the contract work.

From then on, it's a nail biter.

I'm not a scientific person, so I don't know about the IT part of this. But it kept me hooked till the last page.

Good read!",2015-08-01,2015

In fact, it's the only of his books that doesn't feel like there are any extraneous events; everything is necessary. The plot only ever picks up speed until it's riveting finale, and the research by Crichton is so good I'm afraid it could be accomplished in real life by some rogue company!

Crichton also challenges me in all of his novels (sad he is gone) because I often end up looking up the concepts he presents, in this case, the whole concept of swarm behavior.

3.0,0002005549,"This book has an abrupt shift  in style midway through, and readers seem to favor one or the other forms of the book.  The first part of the book is a suspenseful mystery, where out-of-work tech expert Jack, minding house and kids, while his V.P. wife is bringing home bacon,  is becoming suspicious about said wife's activity, perhaps suspecting her of an affair. Hence the mystery/suspense.  The second part of the book is an action adventure Jurassic Park romp with nanotechnology. Technology has once again escaped human control, and going after its creators.

I confess, I like the first part better, and found that part of the book hard to put down.  When it got to the technology awry part, I felt like I had read that story before, and skimmed it a little. Not that it wasn't entertaining, it just was too similar in theme to Jurassic Park. I took a second star off for the ending.  There was a certain lack of believability and huge discrepancies in the abilities of the nanos.  Also some plot holes that I don't think needed  nanotechnology to get through.  That being said, if you don't over think this, it's a good rollicking comic book of a novel, and great to pass an icy shut-in sort of afternoon.",2015-02-23,2015

I was somewhat skeptic in the beginning because it's the first book of his that I've read that is written in the first-person, and it takes some time to get to the ""techno thriller""-centric storyline, but it is definitely a nail biter that will hold you captive until the very last page, and had already become one of my favorite books that I've read several times.

4.0,0002007215,A haunting and powerful story on a topic rarely treated. Japan hasn't done much yet to own to the atrocities committed by its troops in China in the 1937 invasion.

Anna is a beautiful but down-to-earth 5-year-old when the book opens - a foundling whom Fynn (the author) encounters in the streets of London and takes home to his equally grounded and immensely practical mother.  It's a setting made in heaven for Anna, who is a budding physics genius and philosopher just needing Fynn and his mother's unconventional approach to life and education.

Prepare to be astonished at Anna's intuitive understanding of complex physics principles, and delighted by her very straight-talking approach to the constraints of religion and her free-thinking belief in ""Mr God"".",2015-06-24,2015
